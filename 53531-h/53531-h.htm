<h1>Fire-making Apparatus in the U. S. National Museum.</h1>
<p class="center">By <span class="sc">Walter Hough.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Man in his originals seems to be a thing unarmed and naked, and unable to help
itself, as needing the aid of many things; therefore Prometheus makes haste to find
out fire, which suppediates and yields comfort and help in a manner to all human
wants and necessities; so that if the soul be the form of forms, and the hand be the
instrument of instruments, fire deserves well to be called the succor of succors, or
the help of helps, that infinite ways afford aid and assistance to all labors and the
mechanical arts, and to the sciences themselves.
<span class="lr"><span class="sc">Bacon.</span>&mdash;<i>Wisdom of the ancients, Prometheus</i>, Works, vol. iii. Lond., 1825, p. 72.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a prevalent belief that to make fire by rubbing two pieces
of wood is very difficult. It is not so; the writer has repeatedly made
fire in thirty seconds by the twirling sticks and in five seconds with the
bow drill.</p>
<p>Many travelers relate that they have seen various peoples make fire
with sticks of wood. The most common way, by twirling one stick upon
another is well described by Pere Lafitau with reference to the Hurons
and Iroquois.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They take two pieces of cedar wood, dry and light; they hold one piece firmly down
with the knee and in a cavity which they have made with a beaver-tooth or with
the point of a knife on the edge of one of these pieces of wood which is flat and a
little larger, they insert the other piece which is round and pointed and turn and
press down with so much rapidity and violence that the material of the wood agitated
with vehemence falls off in a rain of fire by means of a crack or little canal which
leaps from the cavity over a match [slow match]. This match receives the sparks
which fall, and preserves them for a long time and from which they can make a large
fire by touching it to other dry materials.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these descriptions omit details that are essential to the comprehension
of the reader. There is a great knack in twirling the vertical
stick. It is taken between the palms of the outstretched hands, which
are drawn backwards and forwards past each other almost to the finger
tips, thus giving the drill a reciprocating motion. At the same time a
strong downward pressure, is given which may be called a rotating
pressure. The hands move down the drill; when they nearly reach the
lower end they are brought back to the top with a quick, deft motion.
This is repeated as rapidly as possible. If the lower part of the drill is
observed when the motion begins it will be seen that powder is ground
<span class="pb" id="Page_532">532</span>
off and is collecting in the canal cut into the cavity from the side of the
lower piece of wood. Soon, as the motion progresses, the powder begins
to increase and to get darker, the odor of burning wood is noticed
and the smoke is seen. Probably when the next motion ceases there
will be a little curl of peculiarly colored smoke, which shows that active
combustion has begun. The pellet of ground-off wood may now be
shaken out of the slot or canal. At first it is dark; a thin line of smoke
comes from it; gradually the fire spreads through it until it glows.
In this semi-charred dust the heat is held until it increases to about
450&deg;, or higher. Everything depends on keeping the dust in a heap;
it is impossible to make fire without doing this. This is true in all
kinds of wooden fire-making tools.</p>
<p>By examination of many specimens of aboriginal fire apparatus it is
found that both the drill and lower piece, which, for convenience, shall
be called the hearth, must be of dry, inflammable wood. Wood that is
soft from incipient decay is chosen; most often pieces riddled by worms.
This is the <i>felicis materia</i> spoken of by Festus as used by the Vestals.
Wood of this kind is not only easier of ignition, but it is ground off
more easily and retains the heat generated until enough is accumulated
to ignite the powder. In strong, skillful hands fire can be made
from wood that does not wholly fulfill these conditions.</p>
<p>Woods vary in combustibility, depending on their density, coloring
matter, and, perhaps, their chemical constitution. Sap wood of juniper
and soft, white maple yield fire with the bow, but light mesquite is the
best of all. The vascular, starchy flowering stems of plants have always
been a favorite fire-generating material.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the Eskimo attachments to the simple drill enable
him to use wood ordinarily of no account for making fire. Sand is used
by Indians and other peoples to increase the friction.</p>
<p>From the material in the collection at the Museum, it is found that
nearly every method that is or was used in the world is represented.
The following classification, based upon the presumed order of development
of the invention, is followed in this paper:</p>

<h3 id="c2">1. SIMPLE TWO-STICK APPARATUS.</h3>
<p>This method may be said to have a world-wide distribution, and to
have had no narrow range in time. It is a very interesting study to
observe the many different practices that have been superadded to the
simple task of twirling two sticks with the design of creating fire. It
is also instructive to note how fixed have become tribal characters in
so small a thing as the shaping of the elements of the fire drill. It has
well been said by Dr. Schweinfurth, that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A people, as long as they are on the lowest step of their development, are far better
characterized by their industrial products than they are either by their habits,
which may be purely local, or by their own representations, which (rendered in their
rude and unformed language) are often incorrectly interpreted by ourselves. If we
possessed more of these tokens we should be in a position to comprehend better than
we do the primitive condition of many a nation that has now reached a high degree
of culture.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This fact holds good with reference to tribes in a higher plane than
the learned writer included in this statement, in this way. There are
many little things that have not been subject to the modification of
time, intercourse, or environment, but co-exist with an art. To particularize:
Prof. E. S. Morse has shown the value of the simple act of releasing
an arrow from a bow-string as a classifier. Close attention to
the minor acts and arts will reveal much more than the nice measurements
of man&rsquo;s practically unmodified skeleton.</p>
<p>Differences that have become functional in the arts have come down
from an early period; when they can be found they are of the greatest
value as aids in ethnology.</p>
<p>The ethnography of the simple fire drill is studied geographically,
beginning in North America with the most northerly tribes that use it,
and ranging from north to south in the different sections of the country,
among the tribes from which there are specimens in the Museum.
Other countries are examined from west to east.</p>
<p>The Sitkan fire-drill spindle is unusually long and thick (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). Both
hearth and drills are of the <i>Thuja gigantea</i>, a tree that enters so largely
into the life of the Indians along this coast. The wood grinds off
very well with much friction; at ordinary speed there is soon a small
heap of powder at the bottom of the fire slot. The latter is deeply cut in
from the side nearly to the center of the fire-hole. The whole hearth
has been charred at the fire. This repels moisture, and also renders
it easier to ignite the wood, charring being a process somewhat analogous
to the decay of wood by rotting. If kept carefully in a dry place,
this apparatus was perfectly adequate for the purpose of the Sitkan,
and in his skillful hands would no doubt give the spark in a minute or
so. The long drill would indicate that two worked at it consecutively
<span class="pb" id="Page_534">534</span>
to keep up a continuous motion, as will be noted in the use of the
Aino drill (<a href="#Page_551">p. 551</a>).</p>
<p>For tinder, the bark of the arbor vit&aelig; was used. It is finely frayed,
and is much improved by being slightly charred. They also use, preferably,
a tinder made from a fungus, because it is &ldquo;quicker,&rdquo; <i>i. e.</i>, ignites
more readily than the frayed bark.</p>
<p>The hearth is squared and measures 23 inches; the drill is of equal
length.</p>
<p>Going southward from Sitka the next fire-making set in the series
is from Bella-Bella, British Columbia. These Indians are of the Salishan
stock, and are called Bilhulas. The horizontal is a piece of cedar
wood dressed square on three faces. It is apparently a piece of an oar or
spear handle. The fire holes are shallow, and the fire slots are quite
narrow (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>). The drills have been scored longitudinally near the
rubbing end; this may be a device to cause the wood to wear away more
rapidly, and furnish fuel to the incipient fire. Fire has evidently been
made with this set. Both parts are 1&frac12; feet long; the drill is much
thinner than that of Sitka. The tinder is of frayed cedar bark.</p>
<p>From a southern family of the Salishan stock, called the Quinaielt Indians,
of Washington Territory, the museum has a complete set collected
by the late Charles Willoughby. It consists of a hearth, two
drills, and a slow-match. The hearth is a rounded piece of cedar wood;
opposite the fire-holes it is dressed flat, so as to rest firmly on the ground.
There are three fire-holes with wide notches. The drills taper to each
end, that is, are larger in the middle (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>). The powder, a fine brown
dust, collects at the junction of the slot and fire-hole, where they form
a lip and there readily ignites. This side of the hearth is semi-decayed.
No doubt the slots were cut in that side for the purpose of utilizing this
quality. The drills are bulged toward the middle, thereby rendering
it possible to give great pressure and at the same time rapid rotation
without allowing the hands to slip down too rapidly, a fault in many
fire-drills. The slow-match is of frayed cedar bark, about a yard
long, folded squarely together, and used section by section. Mr. Willoughby
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stick with three cavities was placed upon the ground, the Indian kneeling and
placing a knee upon each end. He placed one end of the smaller stick in one of the
cavities, and, holding the other end between the palms of his hands, kept up a rapid
half-rotary motion, causing an amount of friction sufficient to produce fire. With this
he lighted the end of the braided slow-match of cedar bark. This was often carried
for weeks thus ignited and held carefully beneath the blanket to protect it from wind
and rain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fire is easily procured with this set. It takes but a slight effort to cause
a wreath of aromatic smoke to curl up, and the friction easily grinds off a
dark powder, which collects between the edges of the slot. When this
ignites it drops down the slot in a little pellet, and falls upon the tinder
placed below to receive it. Both drill and hearth are 18 inches long.</p>

<p>The Klamaths, of Oregon, of the
Lutuamian stock, use a fire apparatus
that looks very much like that
of the Utes. The hearth is a
rounded piece of soft wood thinned
down at the ends (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>). The
drill is a long, round arrow-stick,
with a hard-wood point set in with
resin and served with sinew (see
Ute drill, <a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>). The holes in this
hearth are very small, being less
than three-eighths of an inch in
diameter. They are in the center,
and the fire slot being cut into the
rounded edge widens out below, so
that the coal can drop down and get
draught. The wood is quite soft,
apparently being sap-wood of yew
or cedar, while the drill-point is of
the hardest wood obtainable. It is
probable that sand is used on the
drill. The hearth is 13 inches long,
and the drill 26.</p>
<p>The Chinooks, a tribe of Indians
of a separate stock, called Chinookan,
formerly lived about the
mouth of the Columbia River, in
Oregon, but are now nearly extinct.
Hon. James G. Swan, the
veteran explorer, investigator, and
collector among the Northwest
coast tribes, says that the Chinooks
are the best wet-weather
fire-makers he ever knew.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To kindle a fire the Chinook twirls rapidly
between the palms a cedar stick, the
point of which is pressed into a small hollow
in a flat piece of the same material,
the sparks falling on finely frayed bark.
Sticks are commonly carried for the purpose,
improving with use.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Paul Kane<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> describes the
hearth as a &ldquo;flat piece of dry cedar,
<span class="pb" id="Page_537">537</span>
in which a small hollow is cut with a channel for the ignited charcoal
to run over. In a short time sparks begin to fall through the channel
upon finely frayed cedar bark placed underneath, which they soon
ignite.&rdquo; The Ahts and Haidas also use cedar fire-sticks of the usual
Indian kind.</p>
<p>The Hupa Indians of California are of the Athapascan stock. Their
fire-drill is a carefully made piece of apparatus (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>). The hearth is
of a reddish, punky piece, probably of mesquite, <i>Prosopis juliflora</i>,
somewhat harder than the drill, which is charred slightly for some distance
along the grinding end. Fire has been made in one of the holes;
the others show the rough, frayed cavities which have been made to
start the drill. The notches at each end of the hearth seem to be to
facilitate the tying of the pieces together as a precaution to prevent
their loss or separation. They are usually intrusted into the hands of
the most skillful fire-maker, who wraps them up to keep them from becoming
damp. The effectiveness of the sticks increases with use and
age; a stick and hearth that have been charred by the former making
of fire in most cases yields the spark in half the time required for new
apparatus. Another advantage is that the drill is softer from incipient
decay.</p>
<p>That this set is in the highest degree efficient is shown by the fact
that the writer repeatedly got a glowing coal, the size of a pea, from it
in less than twenty seconds. The hearth is 18 and the drill 21 inches
long.</p>
<p>The McCloud River Indians (Copehan stock) make the drill from the
buckeye tree.</p>
<p>The Indians of Washoe, Nevada, from their language, have been
classed by the Bureau of Ethnology as a separate stock, the Washoan.
Stephen Powers, many years ago collected a rather remarkable hearth
from these Indians. It has eight rather small holes, in every one of
which fire has been made. The wood is soft, well-seasoned pine. Apparently
sand has been made use of to get greater friction, as is the
custom of the Zu&ntilde;is and Apaches. This device, in a measure, obviates
the necessity of having tinder-like wood, or wood in a state of partial
decay. For the drill any hardwood cylindrical stick might be employed.
A strip of buckskin about an inch wide is passed around the
hearth over the fire holes to keep them dry (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>).</p>
<p>At the end of the hearth is a mass of cement made of the resin of a
pine mixed with sand, apparently; a kind of material used by the Indians
over a large area in the Great Basin and southward to fix their
arrowheads, pitch the water-bottles, and for other purposes. It is quite
probable that this stick was the property of an arrow-maker, whose
need of fire to melt the somewhat intractable cement, caused him to
combine these functions in one tool.</p>
<p>It has a better finish, and displays greater skill in its manufacture
than the fire-tools of the neighboring tribes of Shoshonian (Utes) and
<span class="pb" id="Page_538">538</span>
Moquelumnian stocks. In fact, it has a close affinity in appearance to
those of the very near Athapascan
(Hupa, etc.) stock. It is a matter
of very great interest to compare
with this a stick from the Mackenzie
River. (See <a href="#fig28">Fig. 28</a>.) The resemblance
is striking; it is as
though one found a word of familiar
sound and import in an unexpected
place. The related tribes
of the Indians dwelling on the
Mackenzie have a wider range than
the distance between the localities
whence the respective sticks came;
in fact, the Athapascans range
about 50 degrees in latitude and
the southern colonies of this great
family are only about 250 miles
southeast of the Washoans, while,
as has been stated, the Hupas are
quite near.</p>
<p>It would be presumptuous to say
at present that this tool is a remnant
of the influence of the Athapascan
wave that swept along
the Great Interior Basin, leaving
groups here and there in California
and other parts to mark its
progress, but there is more to its
credit than a coincidence of form
and function.</p>

</div>
<p>The museum is in possession of a
complete collection of fire-making
material from the tribes of the
Shoshonian stock. They were collected
by Maj. J. W. Powell. The
native name for the Ute fire set is
<i>whu-tu ni-weap</i>. While the lower
member of the set&mdash;the hearth&mdash;differs
among the several tribes in
point of material, shape, etc., the
spliced drill is characteristic of the
whole stock. It has never been
noticed outside of the southern
part of the Great Interior Basin
but in one instance&mdash;among the
<span class="pb" id="Page_539">539</span>
Klamaths of Oregon. The main part of the drill is either a reed, or a
straight sprout, usually the former.
At one end a short piece of very
hard wood&mdash;greasewood, <i>sarcobatus
vermiculatus</i>&mdash;is set in and
lashed with sinew. It resembles
the Shoshonian arrows, which are
foreshafted in this way. They also
use sand in common with other
neighboring tribes.</p>
<p>The Pai-Utes, of Southern Utah,
make their hearths of a short,
rounded piece usually of the sap-wood
of juniper. It is tied to the
drill with a thong of buckskin when
not in use (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>). The drill is like
the usual one, just described. This
is the common form of the Pai-Ute
apparatus. The small, two-holed
hearth of rounded form, and the
shortened, spliced drill are for convenience
of carrying, this kind being
used by hunters while away
from the lodges. Mr. S. J. Hare
says that the men do not usually
make the fire, except when out on
a hunting excursion. At the lodge
it is the squaw&rsquo;s duty to make the
fire when it is needed.</p>

</div>
<p>The Pai-Ute is rarely at a loss to
get fire; he is master of various
devices. Mr. Hare, who was among
the Utes for some time, states that
when the Indian is in need of a
light he uses either the flint and
steel, the drill, or, if these are not
at hand, he takes two branches,
and rubs one up and down on the
other, soon getting fire. The Australians
are said to have practiced
fire-making by rubbing in the way
mentioned. This is the only observation
collected of its occurrence in
America. It is, in all probability,
a difficult, unusual way; only practiced
under pressure of necessity
among the Utes. They take great
<span class="pb" id="Page_540">540</span>
pride in their skill; to be a quick fire-maker is to achieve fame in the
tribe. They are fond of exhibiting their art to white travelers in the
hope of gain.</p>
<p>Another form of hearth (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>) is made of yucca flower stalk, like
those of the Apache and Navajos. The drill is of tule reed, set with a
very hard wood head. It is suggested that the reason for splicing
the drill is that the hard wood of the kind used for the head (greasewood)
can not be procured in pieces long enough to make the whole
drill. This set is apparently one used as a fixture in the Ute domestic
economy, the squaws having to light the fire. The duty is mainly
relegated to the females in several other Indian tribes, and among the
Eskimo. Mr. Catlin says that the Sioux objected to letting the squaws
have their portraits painted, saying that their women had never taken
scalps, nor done anything better than make fires and dress
skins.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
The hearth and drill last figured are respectively 20 and 23 inches
long, while in the hunting set (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>) the length is 7 and 18 inches.</p>
<p>The Wind River Shoshones are also represented (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>). The hearth
is of hard wood, rudely hacked out, and rounded. Upon the slanting
edge are eight holes, or shallow depressions, prepared for the drill,
with notches cut in to meet them from the sides. The drill is a willow
branch, 25 inches long, with a hard wood head mortised in, and served
with buckskin. It is most probable that sand was used with this set,
because, if the parts are not models, it would be necessary to use it on
sticks of equal hardness like these. I am inclined to believe that they
are models, from their appearance, and from the difficulty of setting up a
pyrogenic friction upon them even with sand. They were collected
some fifteen years ago by Maj. J. W. Powell.</p>
<p>The Mokis are the most differentiated members of the Shoshonian
stock. Mrs. T. E. Stevenson collected the two excellent fire-making
sets in the Museum from the Moki Pueblos. The hearth is a branch
of the very best quality of soft wood. In one hearth an end has
been broken off, but there still remain eighteen fire-holes, showing that
it was in use for a long time and highly prized (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>). The drill is a
roughly dressed branch of hard wood. It is comparatively easy to make
fire on this apparatus. In the set numbered 126,694 these conditions are
reversed; the hearth is tolerably hard wood and the drill soft wood.</p>
<p>The Moki fire-tools are used now principally in the estufas to light
the sacred fire and the new fire as do the Zu&ntilde;is, and the Aztecs of
Mexico did hundreds of years ago. They use tinder of fungus or dried
grass rubbed between the hands.</p>
<p>By their language the Zu&ntilde;i people belong to a distinct stock of Indians.
Their fire-sticks are of the agave stalk, a soft, pithy wood with
harder longitudinal fibers, rendering it a good medium for the purpose
of making fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_541">541</div>
<p>As to the plan pursued
in grinding out fire, Col.
James Stevenson informed
the writer that they
make a slightly concave
place where the burnt
holes are seen, cut the
notch on the side, sprinkle
a little fine sand on the
concavity, set the end of
the round stick on the
sand and roll it rapidly
between the palms of the
hands, pressing down
hard. The &ldquo;sawdust,&rdquo; Colonel
Stevenson called it,
oozes out of the notch and
forms a small mass, which
on blowing slightly becomes
a burning coal, and
the application of a little
tinder creates a blaze. For
preserving the fire for any
length of time they use
a piece of decayed wood.

</div>
<p>Viewed in another aspect
than as an implement of
necessary or common use,
this set is an important
cult apparatus in the wonderfully
complicated religious
worship of the Zu&ntilde;is.
These people make the
sacred fire that burns always
in their estufas by
friction of wood that has
been wet. New fire is
made at the beginning of
their new year with great
ceremony. The house is
swept and everything is
moved out of it until the
fire is made. Their regard
for fire and their customs
with reference to it add
<span class="pb" id="Page_542">542</span>
them to the list of peoples who have held it in similar reverence and
have practiced similar customs all over the world,
ranging widely in time. The wetting of the drill,
increasing their labor, may be done to please their
Gods.</p>
<p>This art must have been practiced for a long time
in this region, for Mr. Henry Metcalf found a hearth
(<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>) with three fire-holes in a cave-dwelling at
Silver City, New Mexico. It is apparently very ancient.
The wood is much altered and has become
heavy by impregnation with some salt, probably niter.</p>
<p>The Apaches and Navajos belong to the great Athapascan
stock, that ranges so widely in North America.
Capt. John G. Bourke, U. S. Army, collected the
hearth of yucca wood shown (<a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>), and says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the stick you now see, the Apache Indians in my presence
made fire in not quite eight seconds by the watch, and one
asserted that he could make it in a number
of motions, which, on the watch, occupied
exactly two seconds, that is, under most
favorable circumstances. The experiments,
made under my own observation, ran all
the way from eight to forty-seven seconds;
sand is generally used, although not essential
to success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Captain Bourke&rsquo;s observation is
very interesting, as it records the
fact that the Apache is the most
skillful fire-maker in the world.
Many other tribes can make fire in
less than a minute; I think by far
the majority of them, but there is no
eight-second record, while if he could
prove his ability to do it in two seconds
he would arrive at the facility
of striking a match.</p>

</div>
<p>Mr. William F. Corbusier has noticed
the fire-making of the Apache-Yumas
of Arizona (Yuman stock).<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>
They use a drill about 2 feet long
and one-half inch thick, made of
<i>o-oh-kad-je</i>, or &ldquo;Fire-stick bush.&rdquo; Its
end is dipped in sand and drilled on
a soft piece of agave or yucca stalk
held down by the feet. They carry
a slow torch of dead wood (spunk)
<span class="pb" id="Page_543">543</span>
and also use a flint and steel. For tinder they use
dry grass or bark fiber. They use also a fungus,
<i>polyporus</i> sp., for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Another reference to the fire making of this stock
(Yuman) is found in the translation by the late Dr.
Charles Rau of the writings of Father Baegert on
the Californian Peninsula.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To light a fire, the Californian makes no use of steel and
flint, but obtains it by the friction of two pieces of wood.
One of them is cylindrical and pointed at one end, which fits
into a round cavity in the other, and by turning the cylindrical
piece with great rapidity between their hands, like a
twirling-stick, they succeed in igniting the lower piece if
they continue the process for a sufficient length of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Navajo fire-set looks very much like a mere
makeshift. The hearth is a piece of yucca stalk
and the fire-holes have but a shallow side notch.
The drill is a broken arrow shaft, to which has been
rudely lashed with a cotton rag a smaller piece of
yucca wood (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>). This carelessness, which it is
rather than lack of skill, is characteristic of the Navajos
in their minor implements. They resemble
the crude Apache in this. One thinks of the Navajos
only with regard to their fine blanket weaving
and silver working, so well presented by Dr. Washington
Matthews in the reports of the Bureau of
Ethnology, and does not consider their arts in other
lines.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Thomas C. Battey, a Friend, long missionary
among the Indians, kindly gives a description of
the Kiowan fire-making process, not now practiced
among them, but shown to him as a relic of an
abandoned art:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A piece of very hard and coarse, rough-grained wood, perhaps
8 inches in length, 2 in width, and three-fourths of an
inch in thickness is procured. In one side of this and near
one edge several holes are made, about one-half an inch in
diameter by five-eighths of an inch in depth, rounded at the
bottom, but left somewhat rough or very slightly corrugated.
In the edge nearest these holes a corresponding number of
smaller and tapering holes are made, opening by a small orifice
into the bottom of each of the larger ones. These are
made very smooth.</p>
<p>A straight stick, also of hard, rough-grained wood, about 8
or 10 inches in length, about the size they usually make their
<span class="pb" id="Page_544">544</span>
arrows or larger, is provided. Both ends of this
are rounded, but one end is made smooth, the
other is left slightly rough. The dried pith of
some kind of reed, or more probably of the yucca,
some fibers of the same loosely prepared like
hackled flax, some powdered charcoal, I think
formed by charring the yucca, and a piece of hard
thick leather similar to sole leather, completes
the outfit, which is carried in a leather bag made
for the purpose. The first described piece of
wood is placed upon the knees of the operator
with a quantity of the fibrous substance beneath
it which has been powdered with charcoal dust;
some of the latter is put into one of the holes
and the rough end of the stick inserted, the
other end is put into an indentation of the
leather placed under the chin, so that a gentle
pressure may be exerted. The spindle is then
rapidly revolved by rolling it one way and the
other between the hands. The friction thus produced
by the rubbing of the roughened surfaces
ignites the fine coal dust, which, dropping as
sparks of fire through the orifice at the bottom
of the hole, falls into the dry fibrous preparation,
thus igniting that, then by the breath
blowing upon it a flame is produced and communicated
to some fine dry wood and a fire is
soon obtained. The whole operation occupies
but a few minutes.</p>

<br /><span class="small">(Cat. No. 15396. U. S. N. M. Natives of Talamanca, Costa Rica. Collected by Prof. W. M. Gabb.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>One of the rudest fire-making appliances
in the Museum was collected by
Prof. W. M. Gabb, at Talamanca, Costa
Rica. The hearth is a rude billet of
charred, black wood, resembling mahogany.
It has central holes, with no gutter
usually, though sometimes a shallow
notch is cut on both sides of the fire-hole.
The drill is a light branch, rather
crooked, but dressed down roughly with
a knife. Another hearth is of partly decayed,
worm-eaten wood; with this a
hard wood drill can be used, the hearth
wasting away instead of the drill (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>.) The absence of any fire slot, that
is, the use of the central fire-hole, is
worthy of notice in this locality. I have
only observed its use in various parts of
the Eskimo area, from East Greenland
to Kadiak; outside of this range I have
not noticed it anywhere else among the
present tribes of the world. From descriptions
<span class="pb" id="Page_545">545</span>
given it seems to have been practiced by the Caranchua
Indians, a recently extinct tribe in Texas and Mexico. (See below.)</p>
<p>These specimens from Costa Rica are the crudest fire tools, not to be
mere make-shifts, that have come to my notice or have been described
in the literature examined. The Costa Rican Indians are very interesting
in their preservation of several other arts that may justly be
classed among the most ancient. One may be mentioned, that of bark
cloth making. Professor Gabb made quite a collection from Talamanca,
but has not left any notes on these remarkable people, who are well
worthy of the careful study of ethnologists.</p>
<p>A curious modification of this central hole plan is figured and described
in Oviedo, folio 90, as occurring in Hispaniola; that is, the West
Indies, Hayti, San Domingo, etc. He says that &ldquo;two dry light sticks
of brown wood were tied firmly together, and the point of the drill of
a particular hard wood was inserted between the two and then worked.&rdquo;
Mr. H. Ling Roth<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> thinks that if one can judge from the illustration
(which is a miserable one) in Benzoni&rsquo;s work, the natives of Nicaragua
also used three sticks in making fire. Benzoni, however, says:<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All over India they light fire with two pieces of wood; although they had a great
deal of wax, they knew no use for it, and produced light from pieces of wild pine
wood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Oviedo&rsquo;s description I am inclined to believe that the dust in
which the fire starts was allowed to fall below on tinder placed beneath
the hearth.</p>
<p>Through the kindness of Prof. F. W. Putnam, curator of the Peabody
Museum, at Cambridge, Mass., I have received an extract from a manuscript
written by Mrs. Alice W. Oliver, of Lynn, who, as a girl, in 1838
resided on Matagorda Bay, and learned the language and customs of
the Caranchua Indians, a separate stock, now thought to be extinct.</p>
<p>Mrs. Oliver says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the hut is built a fire is made, the squaws usually begging fire or matches from
the settlers, but, in case their fire is out and they have no other means of kindling it,
they resort to the primitive method of producing it by friction of wood. They
always carry their fire-sticks with them, keeping them carefully wrapped in several
layers of skins tied up with thongs and made into a neat package; they are thus kept
very dry, and as soon as the occasion for their use is over, they are immediately
wrapped up again and laid away.</p>
<p>These sticks are two in number. One of them is held across the knees as they squat on
the ground, and is about two feet long, made of a close-grained, brownish-yellow wood
(perhaps pecan), half round in section; the flat face, which is held upward, is about an
inch across. Three cylindrical holes about half an inch in diameter and of equal
depth, the bottoms slightly concave, are made in it. The three holes are equally
distant apart, about 2 inches, and the first one is the same distance from the end
of the stick, which rests upon the right knee. In one of the holes is inserted the
slightly-rounded end of a twirling stick made of a white, softer kind of wood, somewhat
less than the diameter of the hole, so as to turn easily, and about 18 inches long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_546">546</div>
<p>Holding the twirler vertically between the palms of the hands, a gentle but rapid
alternating rotary motion is imparted. After continuing this for about five minutes
the abrasion of the softer wood causes a fine, impalpable dust to collect in the hole,
from which soon issues a thin, blue line of smoke.</p>
<p>As soon as the Indian sees this he quickly withdraws his twirler with one hand,
while with the other he catches up and crushes a few dry leaves previously placed
on a dry cloth close by (having been produced from thin wrappings, in which they
have been preserved for this very purpose, to serve as tinder), and quickly but
lightly sprinkles them in and around the hole, over which both hands are now held
protectingly, the head bent down, and the incipient fire fanned to a blaze with the
breath. As soon as the blaze has fairly caught, the stick and tinder are deftly turned
over upon a little pile of dry twigs and leaves, got ready beforehand, and the fire is
started.</p>
<p>This operation of getting fire is always performed by the men, and not by the
squaws. The fire is invariably built in the center of the hut, upon the ground, and,
is usually kept burning, for the Indians never slept regularly, but whenever they
pleased, often asleep in the day time and awake nights, or <i>vice versa</i>, as they felt inclined.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c3">3. IROQUOIS WEIGHTED DRILL.</h3>
<p>The Iroquois are unique in America, and perhaps in the world, in
making fire with the pump-drill. Several other tribes in America use
the pump drill to pierce stone and shell, for which purpose it is an excellent
tool, but the mechanical difficulties lying in the way of making
fire with it have only been overcome by the Iroquois. Pump-drills are
intended for light, fine work, with uniform, light pressure; hence, with
little friction. The Iroquois have added this element by increasing the
size of the balance-wheel and stock. Mr. Morgan, in his &ldquo;League of
the Iroquois,&rdquo; p. 381, figures a fire drill with a wooden stock 4 feet long
and 1 inch in diameter. This stock has at the upper end a string and
bow, while near the lower end is a &ldquo;small wheel.&rdquo; Mr. Morgan says
this is &ldquo;an Indian invention of great antiquity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, of the Bureau of Ethnology, has kindly given
the writer a set of apparatus and valuable information with reference
to fire-making among the Iroquois, especially the Onondagas and Tuscaroras.
He states that at times when there is disease among the people
they say it is because the fire is &ldquo;old.&rdquo; They then determine to make
&ldquo;new fire,&rdquo; so all fires are put out and two slippery-elm logs are selected
and one of these is laid on the ground and a <span class="ss">V</span>-shaped notch is cut on
the upper side. In this notch some tinder of dry slippery-elm is put
and three (mystic or sacred number) men at either end work the other
log backward and forward until fire is generated, and from this the fires
are lighted. He believes that the new fire is made at the winter feast
of the Iroquois. They say that the drill with the weight is their
own invention. They use elm for that also. In making the pump-drill
they sometimes cut an elm sapling and work out the drill, leaving
the tap root for the fore part, the knot for the weight, and part of the
stem for the top part of the drill.</p>
<p>It is not improbable that the Iroquois&mdash;the most advanced Indians
in some respects on the continent, invented this use of the widely diffused
pump-drill. It scarcely seems to be a practical way to make fire,
<span class="pb" id="Page_547">547</span>
and, despite the assurances and belief of the Iroquois, is not very ancient,
but was perhaps suggested by the white man. Indeed, Pere Lafitau,
that keen and careful observer, in his &ldquo;Moeurs des Sauvages Ameriquains,&rdquo;
written in 1724, on page 242, gives a description of Indian fire-making
that includes the Iroquois. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hurons, the Iroquois, and the other peoples of North America do not make
fire from the veins of flint, but rub two pieces of wood one against the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follows a description of fire-making, taken probably from the
Iroquois, that is as good an account of the Indian apparatus and the
way of working it as exists in the literature of the subject.</p>
<p>The drill was sufficient for its time for the reason that there was at
that period rarely necessity for generating fire; the art of fire preservation
was at its height.</p>
<p>The Cherokees, the most southerly of the Iroquois, Mr. James Mooney
states, kept fire buried in the mounds upon which the council houses
were built, so that if the house was destroyed by enemies the fire
would remain there for a year or so. The Cherokees use the simple
rotation apparatus, and, as far as Mr. Mooney can ascertain, never used
the pump-drill. They have a tradition that fire originally came out of
an old hollow sycamore tree (<i>Platanus occidentalis</i>).</p>
<p>Capt. John Smith tells how the Indians of Virginia made fire. He
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their fire they kindled presently by chafing a dry pointed sticke in a hole of a little
square piece of wood, that firing itselfe, will so fire mosse, leaves, or anie such like drie
thing that will quickly burn.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing in the first quarter of the next century, Beverley says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They rubbed Fire out of particular sorts of Wood (as the Ancients did out of the
Ivy and Bays) by turning the end of a Piece that is soft and dry, like a Spindle on
its Inke, by which it heats and at length burns; to this they put sometimes also rotten
Wood and dry leaves to hasten the Work.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loskiel says of the Delawares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Formerly they kindled fire by turning or twirling a dry stick, with great swiftness
on a dry board, using both hands.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Cherokees used for a drill the stalk of a composite plant
(senecio), and twirled it on a piece of wood. The art has long been out
of common use, but they employed the wooden drill to make fire for the
Green Corn Dance into the present century, though flint and steel was
then in vogue. Sometimes they passed the bow over drill. The tinder
was of a fungus or dried moss. Mr. James Mooney collected this information
from some of the older men of the tribe in North Carolina,
who have retained the ancient customs and traditions, which the part
of the tribe removed to the West has entirely lost.</p>
<p>The Creeks (Muskogean stock) had a regularly authorized fire-maker,
who early in the morning made fire for the Green Corn Dance. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_548">548</span>
apparatus that he made use of was four sticks placed end to end to form
a square cross. This was oriented, and at the junction of the sticks
new fire was made by friction.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>The Choctaws (also Muskogean) of Mississippi, Mr. M. F. Berry
writes, make fire in the following way: One stick of dry wood that
has a hole in it, with a smaller hole at the bottom going through, is
placed between the feet. Another piece made round and about 3 feet
long is made to revolve rapidly back and forth between the hands in
the hole, and the fire drops through the small hole below. When new
fire was wanted for the Green Corn Dance, or other purposes, three men
would place themselves so that each in turn could keep the stick revolving
without a stop, until fire would drop down through the hole,
which was nursed with dry material into a flame.</p>
<p>This form of the fire hearth is not represented in the collections of
the Museum; the only other description of a process closely like it was
given by Mr. Thomas C. Battey, who observed it among the Kiowas.
It was shown him at that time as a revival of the ancient method (<a href="#Page_543">p. 543</a>).
The pierced fire hearth is somewhat impracticable, except in the Malay
sawing method. In the rotary drill the small hole would come over the
axis of least friction and heat. Unless provision was made for the dust
to fall freely underneath by a double cone perforation worked from
both sides the dust is likely to become obstructed and smother the
fire. It will be seen, too, that it departs very much from the simplicity
of the usual fire drill in the fact that a hole must be made through the
piece of wood, a matter of some difficulty before the introduction of iron
awls.</p>
<p>The Seminoles of Florida, the most Southern Muskoki, have neglected
the art of fire making by simple friction, unless at the starting of the
sacred fire for the Green Corn Dance, says Mr. Clay MacCauley.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> A
fire is now kindled either by the common matches, <i>ma-tci</i>, or by steel
and flint.</p>
<p>Thus it is seen that wherever in the earlier period of the exploration
in this country the observation has been made, the Indian, almost without
exception, was found to be using the friction apparatus, consisting
of two sticks of wood. Some tribes had improved on the working of
the invention, while a very few others had perhaps arrived at the use
of the higher invention of the flint and pyrites.</p>
<p>Returning to the tribes of the wide central plains of our country, we
find that the flint and steel soon displaced the fire-sticks, except for
religious purposes. The Mandans, of the great Siouan stock, were using
flint and steel at the time of Mr. Catlin&rsquo;s visit in 1832.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>There seems to be a great misapprehension among some of the writers
<span class="pb" id="Page_549">549</span>
on ethnology, as to the general use of the bow-drill among the Indians.
In mentioning that the Sioux use the bow-drill, Schoolcraft is quoted as
authority. As a matter of fact the reference is to a &ldquo;made-up&rdquo; figure
of a bow-drill set, marked &ldquo;Dacota.&rdquo; On the same plate there is a
representation of an Iroquois pump-drill that is obviously wrong. The
lower part of the plate is taken up by a picture of an Indian woman
(presumably Californian) pounding acorns in a mortar. To complete
the absurdity the whole plate is entitled &ldquo;Methods of obtaining fire
by percussion,&rdquo; and is placed in the text of a <i>questionnaire</i> on the Californian
Indians, opposite a description of the Californian way of making
fire by twirling two sticks.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Schoolcraft is not to blame for this state of affairs; in those days
illustrations were not ethnological, they were &ldquo;padding&rdquo; gotten up by
the artist. Nowhere in his great work does Mr. Schoolcraft describe
either the Dacota or Iroquois drill. Among the northern Indians in
central and northern Canada, however, the bow is used.</p>
<p>Sir Daniel Wilson, in his work on Prehistoric Man, notes that the
Red Indians of Canada use the drill bow. In August, 1888, at the meeting
of the American association, at Toronto, he gave an account of the
facility with which these Indians make fire. He said that at Nipissing,
on the north shore of Lake Superior, while he was traveling in a pouring
rain, and not having the means wherewith to light a fire, an Indian
volunteered to light one. He searched around for a pine knot and for
tinder, rubbed up the soft inner bark of the birch between the hands,
got a stick from a sheltered place, made a socket in the knot and another
piece of wood for a rest for the drill, tied a thong to a piece of a branch
for a bow. He put the tinder in the hole and rested his breast on the
drill and revolved it with the bow and quickly made fire.</p>
<p>It is perhaps true that some of the Dacotas did use the bow at times,
but it is not correct to place it as the customary tool of the whole stock.
On the contrary, there is evidence that they used the simple means.
Dr. J. Owen Dorsey writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was told in 1879 by the late Joseph La Fl&egrave;che, that the Omahas, prior to the advent
of the white men, made fire by using pieces of the &ldquo;du-&agrave;-du-&aacute;-hi,&rdquo; a grass (?)
that grows in the Sand Hill region of Nebraska, near the sources of the Elkhorn
River. One piece was placed horizontally on the ground, and a slight notch was cut
at one end, wherein a few grains of sand were put. The other stick was held between
the palms of the hands, with one end in the notch of the horizontal stick, and
then rolled first in one direction then in the other till fire was produced. A fresh
notch was made in the first stick whenever the old one became useless, and so on until
it became necessary to procure a new stick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Green Corn Dance of the Minitaries, another Siouan tribe, the
&ldquo;corn is boiled on the fire, which is then put out by removing it with
the ashes and burying them. New fire is made by desperate and painful
exertion, by three men seated on the ground facing each other and
violently drilling the end of a stick into a hard block of wood by rolling
<span class="pb" id="Page_550">550</span>
it between the hands, each one catching it in turn from the others
without allowing the motion to stop until smoke, and at last a spark of
fire is seen and caught in a piece of spunk, when there is great rejoicing
in the crowd.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> The desperate exertion was not necessary, except in
imitation of the Zu&ntilde;i fashion of wetting the drill to create sacred fire.</p>
<p>It will be seen from these references given that the Sioux used the
customary Indian method. Later, they may have used the bow to expedite
the drill when the wood was intractable. The bow may have
been borrowed from more northern tribes, the Algonquians are said to
use it;<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> Mr. Thomas C. Battey says that the Sac-Fox Indians (Algonquian
stock) used a soft wood drill and a hard wood hearth. &ldquo;The
drill was worked by a bow and the fire caught on the end of the drill
and touched to tinder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout South America the art of fire-making with two sticks of
wood is found to be as thoroughly diffused as it is in North America.
Many of the tribes still use it; we may say that in all tribes the use of
flint and steel was preceded by that of the sticks of wood.</p>
<p>The Guanchos, a mixed tribe of herders on the Pampas of Venezuela,
practice a peculiar way of fire-getting. They select a pliant
rod, place one end against the breast and the other against the block
forming the hearth, <i>held on a line with the breast</i>. By pressing against the
rod it is bent and turned rapidly around like an auger. This impracticable
and no doubt very local method is described by Prof. E. B. Tylor.<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>
<p>In Brazil, in the Province of Goyaz, the Chavantes, Cayap&oacute;s, and
Angayt&eacute;s, use the simple fire drill.<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> The Angayt&eacute;s drill figured looks
somewhat like that of the Mokis. It is usually 28<sup>cm</sup>. long for the
hearth, and for the drill 20<sup>cm</sup>. They use the throat skin of the Nandu,
<i>Rhea Americana</i>, for a tinder sack. The Lenguas of the same province
use a strike-a-light consisting of a tinder horn, flint, and steel, which is
also figured in the cited report. This set is very interesting, because
from it, we can say with certainty where the Lengua got it. The steel
is the English &ldquo;flourish,&rdquo; and the flint is the oval, old English shape,
probably broken somewhat by blows. The Lenguas, being on the line
of travel, have adopted the method from English traders. In Rio
Janeiro the Indians had an angular recess at the back of their snuff
mills for the purpose of making fire by friction.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>
<p>The Ainos of Japan formerly used fire-sticks, and are said even yet
to resort to this method when they have no other means of getting fire.
They use also flint and steel, adopted from the Japanese. A specimen
(No. 22257) is figured and described on <a href="#Page_583">page 583</a> of this paper. The fire-sticks
<span class="pb" id="Page_551">551</span>
of the Ainos of Yezo (No. 129970, <a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>) were loaned to the
Museum by Prof. F. W. Putnam, who also secured the following letter
of Mr. D. P. Penhallow, who collected
the sticks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At our request the chief brought several fire-sticks
to my house, together with the necessary
number of men to get fire in the approved
style. Upon examination the sticks were found
to be from 6 to 9 inches long, and very dry.
Our informant stated that they were from the
root of the elm <i>Ulmus campestris</i>, var. <i>l&aelig;vis</i>, and
that it was customary to keep a supply ahead,
as the sticks require to be seasoned for about
one year, by hanging them from the rafters of
the house above the fire. To prepare them for
the process of making fire, a shorter stick was
cut flat on opposite sides, and about midway
of one of the flattened sides a small hole was
made with the point of the knife for the purpose
of establishing the center of action.
Another stick about 9 inches long was then
well sharpened at one end. Three men now
seated themselves in a circle, facing inward,
with the flattened stick notched side uppermost
in the center.</p>
<p>The point of the long stick was now placed
in the notch, and with the stick in a vertical
position and grasped between the extended
palms of the hands, a steady and somewhat
fast rotating pressure was brought to bear,
exactly as in the use of the old-fashioned awl.
As soon as the first man became weary, the
second brought his hands to bear upon the
upper end of the stick, and continued the motion
without allowing it to cease. This was
repeated as often as necessary until fire was
obtained. Owing to the very dry character of
the sticks used, the parts in contact rapidly
wear away, so that the notch quickly becomes
cup-shaped, and the pointed end is correspondingly
rounded, while at the same time the
powdery product is thrown out, forming a
raised ring on all sides. Before long it is observed that the powder acquires a
brownish tinge. This gradually deepens as the temperature rises until finally a delicate
line of smoke warns the operator that the end is near.</p>
<p>The motion is now continued until the smoke is well established, when the vertical
stick is raised, disclosing a spark on its end. The mouth is applied to the opposite
extremity, and by means of a few vigorous pulls as if smoking a cigar, owing to
the porous nature of the stick, the spark is drawn into a flame.</p>
<p>The actual operation as witnessed by us consumed about two hours, and the Ainos
state that the process requires from one and one-half to two and one-half hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sticks figured are the actual ones that were used in the operation
above described.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_552">552</div>
<p>The Japanese formerly used the simple drill; a few are yet preserved
in the temples. Under the name of &ldquo;Sacred fire drill&rdquo; it is described<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a>
as a board 1 foot wide, 1 foot 4 inches long, 1 inch thick, and with a
step 1 inch wide or over on one edge. It has holes and grooves like
the Eskimo hearth. The drill is a stick twirled between the hands.
The parts are of the <i>hi-no-ki</i>, or fire tree, <i>Cham&aelig;ocyparis obtusa</i>. The
drill is called <i>hi-kiri-usu</i>, or fire drilling mortar. It was and perhaps is
yet used for the purpose of drilling fire at the four corners of the temple
inclosure to ward off the calamity of fire. They are said also to have
used the <i>rokuro</i>, or pump-drill. It is interesting to note that the Japanese
carpenter&rsquo;s drill with the iron point is rotated between the palms.
They are still in use. The one figured is in the Tokio Museum.</p>
<p>Prof. Romyn Hitchcock has kindly allowed a drawing to be made of
a photograph which he procured of a sacred fire drill preserved in the
temple called Oyashiro, at Idzumo, Japan (<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>). The hearth of
this set is made of <i>hi-no-ki</i> wood and the drill of the <i>Ut-su-gi, Deutzia
scabra</i>.</p>

</div>
<p>Professor Hitchcock says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fire drill is used at the festivals of the Oyashiro to produce fire for use in cooking
the food offered to the gods. Until the temple was examined officially in 1872,
the head priest used it for preparing his private meals at all times. Since then it
has been used only at festivals and in the head priest&rsquo;s house on the eve of festivals,
when he purifies himself for their celebration in the <i>Imbidous</i>, or room for preparing
holy fire, where he makes the fire and prepares the food.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The art of fire-making by sticks of wood by the method of rotation is,
or has been, as far as we know, universal on the African continent as
it was in the two Americas at the time of the discovery. There is not
a clue as to how the ancient Egyptians generated fire.</p>
<p>The Somalis are a pastoral people of Arab extraction, inhabiting a
large maritime country south of the Gulf of Aden. Their fire-sticks
(<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>) are pieces of branches of brownish wood of equal texture, in
fact the hearth has formerly been used as a drill, as may be seen by its
regularly-formed and charred end. This is another proof that it is not
necessary that the sticks should be of different degrees of hardness.
The grain of the wood, that of the drill being against and the hearth
<span class="pb" id="Page_553">553</span>
with the grain, in effect accomplishes what the use of wood of different
qualities results in. The hearth and drill are in the
neighborhood of 12 inches long, the former with a diameter
of three-eighths of an inch and the latter one-fourth
of an inch. They were collected by Dr. Charles Pickering
in 1843.</p>
<p>It is possible that the Somalis may have carried this
method with them from Arabia. They conquered this
coast, driving back the earlier tribes inhabiting the country
in the early part of the fifteenth century. Long since
that time, and even now, some Arab tribes practice the
drilling of wooden sticks to produce fire.</p>

<br /><span class="small">After H. H. Johnston. (See Jour. Soc. Arts, June 24, 1887.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>In eastern equatorial Africa the Wataveita, says Mr. H.
H. Johnston, generate fire in the common African way
by rapidly drilling a hard-pointed stick into a small hole
in a flat piece of wood. An interesting bit of custom
comes out in connection with this art among the people.
&ldquo;It is the exclusive privilege of the men, and the secret
is handed down from father to son, and never under any
conditions (as they say) revealed to women.&rdquo; I asked
one man why that was. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if women knew
how to make fire they would become our masters.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> The
figure (<a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>) shows how this people of the great Bantu
stock make fire; this tribe visited by Mr. Johnston lives
on the slopes of the beautiful Kilimanjaro Mountain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_554">554</div>
<p>Mr. R. W. Felkin<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a>, in a study of the Maidu or Moru negroes of
Central Africa, 5&deg; north latitude, 30&deg; 20&prime; east longitude, describes the
fire-making of that tribe. He says that one piece of wood about the
size and shape of a large pencil is rotated in a hole in a flat piece of
hard wood. One man holds the wood steady whilst two others take it
in turn to rotate the stick. This article of Mr. Felkin&rsquo;s is commended to
ethnologists as a model ethnologic study in method and research.</p>
<p>That veteran and renowned explorer, Dr. Schweinfurth, gives the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The method of obtaining fire, practiced alike by the natives of the Nile lands and
of the adjacent country in the Welle system, consists simply in rubbing together two
hard sticks at right-angles to one another till a spark is emitted. The hard twigs of
the <i>Avona senegalensis</i> are usually selected for the purpose. Underneath them is placed
either a stone or something upon which a little pile of embers has been laid; the
friction of the upper piece of wood wears a hole in the lower, and soon a spark is
caught by the ashes and is fanned into a flame with dry grass, which is swung to and
fro to cause a draught, the whole proceeding being a marvel which might well-nigh
eclipse the magic of my lucifer matches.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kaffir fire-making is described in some detail in the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Kaffir blacksmith never need trouble himself about the means of obtaining a
fire. Should he set up his forge in the vicinity of a Kraal, the simplest plan is to
send his assistant for a fire-brand from one of the huts. But if he should prefer, as
is often the case, to work at some distance from the huts, he can procure fire with
perfect certainty, though not without some labor. He first procures two sticks, one
of them taken from a soft-wood tree and the other from an acacia or some other tree
that furnishes a hard wood. Of course both sticks must be thoroughly dry, a condition
about which there is little difficulty in so hot a climate. His next care is to
shape one end of the hard stick into a point and to bore a small hole in the middle of
the soft stick. He now squats down * * * places the pointed tip of the hard
stick in the hole of the soft stick, and, taking the former between his hands, twirls
it backwards and forwards with extreme rapidity. As he goes on the hole becomes
enlarged and a small quantity of very fine dust falls into it, being rubbed away by
the friction. Presently the dust is seen to darken in color, then to become nearly
black, and presently a very slight smoke is seen to rise. The Kaffir now redoubles
his efforts; he aids the effect of the revolving stick by his breath, and in a few more
seconds the dust bursts into a flame. The exertion required by this operation is very
severe, and by the time the fire manifests itself the producer is bathed in perspiration.</p>
<p>Usually two men at least take part in fire-making, and by dividing the labor
very much shorten the process. It is evident that if the perpendicular stick be thus
worked, the hands must gradually slide down until they reach the point. The solitary
Kaffir would then be obliged to stop the stick, shift his hands to the top, and
begin again, thus losing much valuable time. But when two Kaffirs unite in fire-making,
one sits opposite the other, and as soon as he sees that his comrade&rsquo;s hands
have nearly worked themselves down to the bottom of the stick he places his own
hands on the top, continues the movement, and relieves his friend. Thus the movement
of the stick is never checked for a moment, and the operation is consequently
hastened. Moreover, considerable assistance is given by the second Kaffir keeping
the dust properly arranged round the point of the stick and by taking the part of the
bellows, so as to allow his comrade to expend all his strength in twirling.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_555">555</div>
<p>It is an anomaly that the African, to light the fire to smelt the iron
out of which he forges his remarkable weapons, should use sticks of
wood.</p>
<h3 id="c4">2. ESKIMO FOUR-PART APPARATUS.</h3>
<p>The arts of the Eskimo yield more satisfactory results to students of
comparative ethnology than those of any other people.</p>
<p>In all their range the culture is uniform; one finds this fact forced
upon his observation who has examined the series of specimens in the
National Museum, where they are arranged in order by localities from
Labrador to southern Alaska. Prof. Otis T. Mason&rsquo;s paper on Eskimo
throwing-sticks<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> gave a new interpretation to this fact and powerfully
forwarded the study of ethnology by showing the classificatory value
of the distribution of an art.</p>
<p>Professor Mason points out that though the Eskimo culture is uniform
in general, in particular the arts show the modification wrought
by surroundings and isolation&mdash;tribal individuality, it may be called&mdash;and
admit of the arrangement of this people into a number of groups
that have been subjected to these influences.</p>
<p>The Eskimo fire-making tools in the Museum admit of an ethnographic
arrangement, but in this paper it is not found necessary to
make a close study of this kind. From every locality whence the Museum
possesses a complete typical set, it has been figured and described.</p>
<p>The Eskimo are not singular in using a four-part apparatus, but are
singular in the method of using it. The mouth-piece is the peculiar
feature that is found nowhere else.</p>
<p>The drilling and fire-making set consists of four parts, viz:</p>
<p>The mouth-piece,&mdash;sometimes a mere block of wood, ivory, or even the
simple concave vertebra of a fish, or the astragalus of a caribou. More
often, they show great skill and care in their workmanship, being carved
with truth to resemble bear, seals, whales, and walrus. The seal is
the most common subject. The upper part is almost always worked
out into a block, forming a grip for the teeth. The extent to which
some of these are chewed attests the power of the Eskimo jaw. Frequently
the piece is intended to be held in the hand, or in both hands,
hence it has no teeth grip. In the under part is set a piece of stone, in
which is hollowed out a cup-shaped cavity to hold the head of the drill.
These stones seem to be selected as much for their appearance as for
their anti-friction qualities. They use beautifully-mottled stone, marble,
obsidian, and ringed concretions.</p>
<p>The drill is always a short spindle, thicker than any other drill in
the world. It is frequently of the same kind of wood as the hearth.</p>
<p>The thong is the usual accompaniment of the fire drill. It is rawhide
of seal or other animals. The handles have a primitive appearance;
they are nearly always made of bears&rsquo; teeth, hollow bones, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_556">556</span>
bits of wood. Sometimes handles are dispensed with. Mr. Warren
K. Moorhead found some perforated teeth in an Ohio mound that in every
respect resemble the Eskimo cord handles. They have also been found
in caves in Europe decorated with concentric circles like those on the
Eskimo specimens.</p>
<p>The bows are among the most striking specimens from this people.
They are pared down with great waste from the tusks of the walrus,
taking the graceful curve of the tusk. The Museum possesses one 24&frac12;
inches long. It is on their decoration that the Eskimo lavishes his utmost
art. The bow does not lend itself well to sculpture, as does the
mouth-piece; so he covers the smooth ivory with the most graphic and
truthful engravings of scenes in the active hunting life in the Arctic, or
he tallies on it the pictures of the reindeer, whales, seals, and other animals
that he has killed.</p>
<p>Professor Baird was interested more with these bows than with any
other Eskimo products, and desired to have them figured and studied.</p>
<p>The distribution of the bow is remarkable. It is not found south of
Norton Sound, but extends north and east as far as the Eskimo range.
The Chukchis use it,<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> but the Ostyaks use the ancient breast drill.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></p>
<p>The bow is used by individuals in boring holes. It is presumed that
its use as a fire-making tool is secondary, the cord and handles being
the older. The difficulty of making fire is greatly increased when one
man attempts to make it with the compound drill; at the critical moment
the dust will fail to ignite; besides, there is no need of one man
making fire; a thing that is for the common good will be shared by
all. Hence the cord with handles, which usually requires that two men
should work at the drill, is as a rule used by the Eskimo.</p>
<p>Though the Sioux, and some other North American tribes, made use
of the bow to increase the speed of the drill, they did not use the thong
with handles, nor was the bow common even in tribes of the Siouan
stock that had attained to its use (see remarks <a href="#Page_549">p. 549</a>). The bow may be
termed a more advanced invention, allowing one man with ease to bore
holes.</p>
<p>The hearth is made of any suitable wood. It is commonly stepped
and has slots. The central hole with groove is also found. These
hearths are preserved carefully, and fire has been made on some of them
many times.</p>
<p>The distribution of the central-hole hearth (see <a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>, pl. <span class="small">LXXIV</span>), and
the slot-and-step hearth (see <a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a>), is rather striking. The central holes
are found in the specimens observed from the north coast of Alaska, Insular
British America, and Greenland, exclusively. The stepped hearth
with edge holes and slots is by far the more common in western Alaska,
though the other method crops out occasionally; both ways are sometimes
used in the same tribe. More often, the central holes are bored
on a groove (<a href="#fig34">fig. 34</a>), which collects the ground-off particles and facilitates
ignition. Rarely fire is made by working the drill on a plane surface,
in single, non-connecting holes.</p>

<p>The difference between these features is, that it is found to be more
difficult to get fire by a single hole without groove, or slot, than when
the latter features are added. The powder forms a ring around the
edge of the hole, is liable to be dispersed, and does not get together in
sufficient amount to reach the requisite heat for ignition. Of course
this is obviated when a second hole is bored connecting with the first,
when the latter becomes a receptacle for the powder.</p>
<p>It is found that these different ways are due to environmental modification,
showing itself as remarkably in fire-making, as in any other
Eskimo art. Both the stepped and central-hole hearth are different
devices for the same end. The step on the hearth is to keep the pellet
of glowing powder from falling off into the snow, so universal in Eskimo-land;
hence, the simple hearth of primitive times and peoples of
warmer climates has received this addition. The same reason caused
the Eskimo to bore the holes in the middle of the block.</p>
<p>By following the distribution of the center hole method, a clew may
perhaps be gotten to the migrations of the Eskimo.</p>
<p>From Labrador to Norton Sound, by the collections in the Museum,
the center hole is alone used; south of Norton Sound both methods
prevail, with a preponderance of the stepped-hearth species. The step
seems to be an addition to the Indian hearth; the center is an independent
invention.</p>
<p>The operation of the drill is well told in the oft-quoted description
by Sir. E. Belcher. The writer can attest to the additional statement,
that the teeth of civilized man can scarcely stand the shock. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The thong of the drill bow being passed twice around the drill, the upper end is
steadied by a mouth-piece of wood, having a piece of the same stone imbedded, with
a counter-sunk cavity. This, held firmly between the teeth, directs the tool. Any
workman would be astonished at the performance of this tool on ivory; but having
once tried it myself, I found the jar or vibration on the jaws, head, and brain, quite
enough to prevent my repeating it.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ethnographical study of the Eskimo fire-drill begins with Labrador,
including Greenland and following the distribution of the people
among the islands and around the North American coast, to Kadiak
Island and the Aleutian chain. The following is an interesting account
from Labrador, showing what a man would do in the exigency:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He cut a stout stick from a neighboring larch, and taking out the leather thong
with which his moccasins were tied, made a short bow and strung it. He then
searched for a piece of dry wood, and having found it, cut it into shape, sharpened
both ends, and twisted it once around the bowstring; he then took a bit of fungus
from his pocket and put it into a little hole which he made in another dry piece of
wood with the point of the knife. A third piece of dry wood was fashioned into a
handle for his drill.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_558">558</div>
<p>Eskimo in other localities often use such make-shifts. Cup cavities
are often observed in the handles of knives and other bone and ivory
tools where they have used them for heads of the fire-drill.</p>
<p>Cumberland Gulf is the next locality to the northward. There are
several specimens in the collection from this part of Baffin Land, procured
by the famous explorer, Captain Hall, and the less known, but
equally indefatigable Kumlein. The fire-making implements from
Cumberland Gulf have a markedly different appearance from those of
any other locality in the Eskimo area. They have a crude look, and
there is a paucity of ornamention unusual among this people. The
drill bow is one of the things which the Eskimo usually decorates, but
these bows have not even a scratch.</p>
<p>It can be inferred that in Baffin Land, more unfavorable conditions
prevail than in southern Alaska. It must be this cause coupled with
poor food supply, that have conspired to make them the most wretched
of the Eskimo.</p>
<p>The hearth (<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>, pl. <span class="small">LXXIV</span>) is of drift oak. It was collected at Frobisher
Bay by Capt. Charles F. Hall. It has central holes, and appears
to be very unfavorable wood for fire-making. The block hearth is also
from Frobisher Bay (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>, pl. <span class="small">LXXIV</span>). It is an old piece of hemlock,
with two central communicating holes. The mouth-piece is a block of
ivory. Another mouth-piece is a bit of hard wood soaked in oil; it was
used with a bone drill having an iron point. A very small, rude bow
goes with this set (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>).</p>

<br /><span class="small">(Angmagsalik Eskimo, E. Greenland. Copied from G. Holm&rsquo;s Ethnologisk of Angmagsalikerne, 1887.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Our knowledge of eastern Greenland has been very much increased
by the explorations of Holm
and Garde, who reached a
village on the east coast
never before visited by a
white man. Extensive collections
were made, both of
information and specimens.
In reference to fire-making,
Mr. Holm reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They make fire by turning a
hard stick, of which the socket end
is dipped in train oil, very rapidly
around by means of a sealskin
thong with handles. This stick is
fixed at one end into a head set
with bone, and the other end is pressed down into a cavity on the lower piece of wood
(<a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>). Therefore there must be two persons in order to make a fire. One turns
the drill with the cord, while the other presses it down on the hearth; both support
the block with their feet. As soon as the dust begins to burn they fan it with the
hand. When it is ignited, they take it and put it into dried moss (<i>sphagnum</i>), blow
it, and soon get a blaze. In this way they make a fire in an incredibly short time.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_559">559</div>
<p>In the preliminary report, Mr. Holm gives the time at almost less
than half a minute. It was made by the Eskimo, Illinguaki, and his
wife, who, on being presented with a box of matches, gave up their
drill, saying that they had no farther use for it.</p>
<p>In the same report Mr. Holm gives an interesting note. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This fire apparatus is certainly better developed than that which has been described
and drawn by Nordenski&ouml;ld from the Chukchis (Voy. of the <i>Vega</i>, <span class="small">II</span>, p. 126).
The principle is the same as the Greenlander&rsquo;s drill, which they employ for making
holes in wood and bone, and which is furnished with a bow and mouth-piece.<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>.)</p>

</div>
<p>The central holes of this hearth are worthy of note, occurring in the
farthest eastern locality of the Eskimo, and in Labrador.</p>
<p><i>Western Greenland.</i>&mdash;The material in the Museum from western
Greenland is very scanty. The southern coast has been settled for so
long a time that the Eskimo and many of their arts have almost become
extinct. No view of fire-making in Greenland would be complete
without Davis&rsquo;s quaint description of it, made three hundred years ago,
but it was the upper end of the spindle that was wet in Trane. A
Greenlander &ldquo;begaune to kindle a fire in this manner: He tooke a
piece of a boord wherein was a hole half thorow; into that hole he puts
the end of a round sticke like unto a bedstaffe, wetting the end thereof
in Trane, and in a fashion of a turner with a piece of lether, by his
violent motion doeth very speedily produce fire.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a></p>
<p>Eskimo graves and village sites yield evidence also that the fire-making
tools were not different from those at present used higher north
along the coast, and on the east coast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_560">560</div>
<p>Dr. Bessels, speaking of Itah Eskimo of Foulke Fiord in Smith Sound,
says: &ldquo;The catkins of the arctic willow are used as tinder to catch the
sparks produced by grinding two pieces of stone. Also
the widely diffused &lsquo;fire-drill&rsquo; is found here; the spindle
is held between a piece of bone and a fragment of semi-decayed
wood, and is set in motion by the well-known
bow, and is turned until the wood begins to ignite.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a></p>
<p>The &ldquo;fire-bag&rdquo; is an accompaniment to all sorts of fire-making
apparatus. The fire-bag shown (<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>, pl.
<span class="small">LXXV</span>) was collected by Captain Hall, at Holsteinberg,
western Greenland in 1860. It is made of sealskin, and
is a good specimen of the excellent needlework of these
Eskimo. It was used to carry, more especially, the fire-drill
and tinder which require to be kept very dry.</p>
<p>There is a wide gap in the collections of the Museum
between the locality of the specimen just mentioned, and
the fire hearth from the Mackenzie River (<a href="#fig28">fig. 28</a>). This
specimen is from Fort Simpson presumably,
where B. R. Ross collected. It is
said to be difficult to discriminate the
Eskimo from the Indian on the lower
Mackenzie. This hearth may be Indian,
as it has that appearance; besides, no
Eskimo hearth yet observed has side
holes and slots like this without the
step. The Indians of this region are of
the great Athapascan stock of the North.
The close resemblance of this stick to
the one from the Washoans of Nevada
has been commented upon. (See <a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>,
<a href="#Page_537">p. 537</a>.)</p>
<p>There is also a very fine old central-hole
hearth from the Mackenzie River,
collected also by Mr. Ross. It is a rough
billet of branch wood, cut apparently
with an axe, or hatchet (<a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>). It is
semi-decayed and worm-eaten. It has
ten central holes where fire has been
made; they are quite deep, forming a
gutter in the middle of the hearth. There
is, as can be seen, no need of a groove,
as the dust falls over into the next hole,
collects in a mass, and ignites.</p>

<p>The Anderson River set is a very complete and interesting outfit. It
was collected many years ago by C. P. Gaudet. The parts are small
for convenience of carrying. It is the custom of those who live in snow-covered
regions to wrap the drill and hearth together very carefully to
keep them dry, as these are the
essential parts of the apparatus.
It does not matter about the
mouth-piece or bow. In this example
there is a groove cut along
the bottom of the hearth in order
to facilitate tying the drill and
hearth securely together. The
hearth is a square block of soft
wood with three central holes (<a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>).</p>
<p>The other parts of this set are
also worthy of consideration. The
mouth-piece is set with a square
piece of black stone. The part
held in the mouth is very much
chewed. One of the wings has a
hole for tying, as has the hearth.</p>
<p>This is an usual Eskimo precaution
to prevent small objects from
being lost in the snow. The drill
is short, being only 7 inches long.
The bow is the fibula of a deer,
pierced at each end for the frayed
thong of sealskin. It has a primitive
look, but it admirably serves
its purpose.</p>
<p>The Point Barrow set was collected
by the most successful expedition
under charge of Lieut. P.
H. Ray, U. S. Army. The knuckle-bone
of a deer serves as a mouth-piece,
the cup cavity and its general
shape fitting it for the purpose
admirably.</p>

<br /><span class="small">(Cat. No. 1327 U. S. N. M. Eskimo of Anderson River, B. C. Collected by C. P. Gaudet.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The drill is regularly made of
light pine wood; it is slightly
smaller in the middle. The hearth is a rudely rounded piece of pine.
A fragment has been split off, and on this surface a groove has
been cut and three fire-holes bored along it. The thong is without
handles; it is used to tie the parts together when they are not in
<span class="pb" id="Page_562">562</span>
use. A bunch of willow twigs, the down of which is used as tinder,
is also shown (<a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a>).</p>
<p>This set is especially interesting, because it shows the degeneration
of an art. The fire-drill is so rarely
used at Point Barrow, Mr. John
Murdoch says, that it was not possible
to get a full set devoted to
that purpose. Those here shown
are a make-shift. The method only
survives by the conservatism of a
few old men of the tribe, who still
cling to old usages. One of these
made the drill for Lieutenant Ray,
telling him that it was the kind
used in old times. It seems primitive
enough; the knuckle-bone
might well have been the first
mouth-piece. The Eskimo farther
east sometimes use a fish vertebra
for the same purpose; one from the
Anderson River has this. The cord
without handles is undoubtedly the
earliest form also.</p>
<p>The small wooden and bone
mouth-pieces of the Eskimo east
of Point Barrow to Cumberland
Gulf seem to be copies of the deer
knuckle-bone. Another primitive
adaptation is found in an Anderson
River bow, which is made of the
fibula of a deer (see <a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>).</p>
<p>The fire-making drill collected
from the Chukchis by the <i>Vega</i> expedition
in the Cape Wankerem region,
in northeastern Siberia, about
the same latitude as Point Barrow,
is figured in Nordenski&ouml;ld&rsquo;s
Report.<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> It is worked by a bow,
and the drill turns in a mouth-piece
of a deer astragalus like the
Point Barrow specimen. The block
has central holes, with short
grooves running into each one.</p>

</div>
<p>Nordenski&ouml;ld&rsquo;s description of the
manner of making fire is very detailed.
<span class="pb" id="Page_563">563</span>
He records that the &ldquo;women appear to be more accustomed
than the men to the use of this implement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gives also a most interesting observation on the use of a weighted
pump drill among the Chukchis. The Chukchis also use flint and
steel.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></p>
<p>The drilling set from Point Barrow (pl. <span class="small">LXXVI</span>, <a href="#fig32">fig. 32</a>), will show
the appearance of the parts of the fire-drill if we substitute the round
stick for the flint drill. Some of the old drill stocks are pointed with
finely chipped flint heads. The length of these points varies from 2 to 4
inches; the transverse section of one would be a parabola. They are
in general more finely wrought than any of the prehistoric drills found
in various localities all over the world. Prehistoric man was an adept
in the art of drilling stone, bone, and shell; the stone tubes, some of
them 18 inches long, bored very truly, are triumphs of the American
Indians. Without doubt the prehistoric drill points were mounted like
the Eskimo specimen, and were, perhaps, twirled between the hands,
the almost universal method of using the fire-drill. Japanese carpenters
drill holes in this way.</p>
<p>The winged mouth-piece is also a good example of workmanship. It
is set with a mottled, homogeneous stone that is tolerably soft, which
gives a minimum friction. This stone is much affected by the tribes
over quite an extent of coast for labrets, etc. It is probably an article
of trade as are flints. The bow is of walrus tusk, accurately made, but
poorly engraved in comparison with the life-like art work of the southern
Eskimo.</p>
<p>Another drilling set is from Sledge Island (pl. <span class="small">LXXVII</span>, <a href="#fig33">fig. 33</a>). The
Museum has no fire-making specimen from this locality. The drill
stock is set with a point of jadeite lashed in with sinew cord. The bow
is of walrus ivory; it is rounded on the belly and flat on the back.
All Eskimo bows of ivory have a like curve, no doubt determined by
the shape of the walrus tusk. In another, the most common form of
the bow, its section is nearly an isosceles triangle, one angle coming in
the center of the belly of the bow. The head is intended to be held in
one or both hands; it agrees in form with the rude St. Lawrence
Island heads.</p>
<p>Mr. E. W. Nelson collected at Unalakleet, in Norton Sound, a fire-drill,
and the native names of the parts. The name of the set is
<i>&#335;&#335;-j&#335;&#335;-g&#365;-tat</i>; the mouth-piece, <i>n&#259;-gh&#335;&#335;-tuk</i>; the drill, <i>&#335;&#335;-j&#335;&#335;-ga-tuk</i>;

<p>This is a complete set (<a href="#fig34">fig. 34</a>) in first-rate order. The hearth has
central holes along a deep median groove. Its bottom is flat, and it is
rounded off on the sides and ends. All the parts are of pine wood,
decorated in places with red paint. The drill is quite long, much longer
than in any Eskimo set observed. It resembles more the Indian drill
<span class="pb" id="Page_564">564</span>
for rubbing between the hands. The bow is of
wood, which also is quite the exception in other
Eskimo regions, where it is of ivory. There are
many bows of antler from Norton Sound in the
Museum, some of them skillfully and truthfully
engraved. The mouth-piece is plain; not very
well made. It is set with a square block of
marble. It has the usual hole in one of the
wings for the passage
of a thong.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_565">565</div>
<p>Cape Vancouver is represented by a fine old hearth. This object
has evidently been prized by its owner; it has had two rows of fire-holes
(<a href="#fig35">fig. 35</a>), one row bored on the step in front of the first holes made;
some of the holes are bored clear through. The reason why this was
valued is, because the wood is so tindery that it is easy to make fire
upon it.</p>
<p>Chalitmute, in the Kuskokwim region, on the northern side of the
bay of that name, opposite Nunivak Island, is the next locality southward,
to be considered. The parts of this set are exceptionally well-finished.
The hearth is (pl. <span class="small">LXXVIII</span>, <a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a>) stepped. It has four holes
prepared for use; on one, fire has been made. The drill is unusually
thick. The mouth-piece has no teeth-grip, and there is no evidence
that it was ever held in the mouth. It is intended to be held in the
hand. This mouth-piece is set with an oval socket-stone of black
obsidian, ground down into facets and polished. The cord handles
are fine, large teeth of the sea lion. The centers of the circles so characteristic
of Eskimo art, are inlaid with wood. The holes for the
drill cord are narrow; they must have been dug through with a sharp,
narrow instrument. As before remarked, this is the region where the
hand rest is more used than the mouth-piece, and the bow is not used
at all.</p>
<p>The fire-making set from the Togiak River, was collected in 1886, by
Sergt. I. Applegate, of the U. S. Signal Corps. Kassianamute, from
which village it comes, is in the Bristol Bay region, but this set has a
different appearance from the former outfits (pl. <span class="small">LXXIX</span>., <a href="#fig37">fig. 37</a>). The
hearth is a block of wood worked out at one end into a handle. It is
remarkable in having central holes not connecting, and with no connecting
grooves. In this it closely resembles the block from East
Greenland (<a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>). This hearth is of soft, tindery wood, and doubtless
when the holes became too deep to allow the powder to mass around the
edge, the upper part of hearth was scarped down. The mouth-piece is
large, and is in the form of a seal. It has only a shallow, crescentic
teeth-grip; from the size of the mouth-piece, its shape, and the absence
of a block to fasten between the teeth, it must have been nearly always
held in the hand of one of the operators. It is set with a round pebble,
mottled with green. The cord is a thong of rawhide with handles of
wood.</p>
<p>The next locality is Koggiung, on the southern shore of Bristol Bay,
near its head. Two sets are shown from this locality. From the
hearths it will be seen that both fire-slots on the side and center holes
are used here. These sets are called <i>n&#365;-tsh&#365;n</i> (<a href="#fig38">fig. 38</a>). The apparatus
shown in figure 38 has the stepped hearth. Both drill and hearth apparently
have been made for sale. The mouth-piece is a good one, set with a
large socket-piece of a black stone with green mottlings. This stone
is tolerably soft. It is much used by the Bristol Bay Eskimo for
making labrets, etc. The teeth-grip is very shallow. The hearth
(<a href="#fig39">fig. 39</a>) is of a very peculiar shape; only one other has been noticed like
it. The wood is of the best kind, and fire has been made on it a number
of times. In several places the holes have been bored clear through.
The mouth-piece bears no evidence that it has been held between the
teeth. It is highly probable that fire was made on these outfits more
often by two persons, one holding the mouth-piece, or rest, and fanning
the flame, the other pulling the cord. This must be the method in
Bristol Bay. Neither the true mouth-piece nor any bow has been procured
by the Museum from this interesting region, from whence there
are copious collections of ethnological objects. The cords without handles
are worthy of notice.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_568">568</div>
<p>Another set from Bristol Bay is said by its collector, Charles McKay,
to be used by both Eskimo and Indians. It is a very valuable outfit
because of its completeness (pl. <span class="small">LXXX</span>, <a href="#fig40">fig. 40</a>). The hearth is a rounded
piece of wood with four large holes opening by slots onto the step. The
drill is a thick, tolerably hard piece of close-grained
wood like the hearth. The mouth-piece
has no regular block for the teeth-grip,
but has a crescentic gash on each side instead.
It is set with a socket of a rock resembling
marble. Nearly all the mouth-pieces
south of Norton Sound are in the shape of
seals, or other long animals. Cord handles
are used attached to a thick thong of buckskin.
Fungus is used for tinder and a blaze
is started with cones of the larch. These are
kept in the box, the lid of which is tied on
with a thong.</p>
<p>Kadiak, the lowest limit of the western Eskimo,
is as far south as the four part fire-drill
extends by specimens in the Museum (<a href="#fig41">fig. 41</a>).
The hearth is of cedar wood with three central
holes with a connecting groove. It is
neatly finished. The drill is also of cedar and
bears the marks of the use of the thong; the
top has also been used in the socket of a rest.
The drill approaches in length those used
for twirling between the hands by the Indians.</p>
<p>While the Aleutians use flint and steel, or
a stone containing quartz and pyrites, struck
against another stone, they still make use of
the four-part drill at certain times. Hunting
parties, says Mr. L. M. Turner, carry the drill
to use when their matches run out. It takes
two men to work it, one holding the hand rest
and the other pulling the thong. The spindle
is made of harder wood, so as to wear the light
dust which ignites, from the hearth. A moment
only is necessary to get fire; this is fed
with tinder made of willow catkins and powdered
charcoal. Sometimes, in order to get
fire, they hold tinder at the mouth of a gun
and ignite it by firing off a light charge of
loose powder.</p>

</div>
<p>Possessed of four methods of getting fire,
the Aleutian is superior to more fortunately
situated people who depend wholly on
matches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_569">569</div>
<h2 id="c12">II. FIRE-MAKING BY SAWING.</h2>
<p>Prof. Alfred Russel Wallace has noted the method by sawing in his
work entitled &ldquo;The Malay Archipelago,&rdquo; p. 332: Two pieces of bamboo
are used; a sharp edge piece like a knife is rubbed across a convex piece
in which a notch is cut, nearly severing the bamboo (<a href="#fig42">fig. 42</a>); after sawing
across for awhile the bamboo is pierced, and the
heated particles fall below and ignite. The Ternate
Malays and the Tungaras of British North
Borneo<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a>
have improved upon this by striking a piece of china
with tinder held with it against the outside of a
piece of bamboo, the siliceous coating of the latter
yielding a spark like flint. Both of the methods
mentioned are in use at different points in the area
affected by Malay influence.</p>
<p>The Chittagong hill tribes, on the eastern frontier
of British India, use sand on the sawing knife to
increase the friction.<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a></p>
<p>The Karens of Burma, Dr. R. M. Luther informs
the writer, hollow out a branch of the <i>Dipterocarpus</i>
tree like the lower piece of bamboo spoken of, cut a
transverse notch, and saw across in it with a rubber
of iron-wood. The wood fibers ground off form the
tinder; the coal is wrapped up in a dry leaf and
swung around the head till it blazes. It takes only
two or three minutes to get a blaze this way.</p>
<p>Bearing upon the origin of this method of sawing
in these localities, nature is alleged to suggest the
way and to repeat the process that would give to
tireless man the hint. Mr. W. T. Hornaday relates
that many fires are started in the jungle by bamboo
rubbing together in a high wind-storm. The creaking
is indescribable; the noise of the rasping and
grinding of the horny stems is almost unendurable.</p>
<p>In many tribes it is found that often there is more
than one method of fire-making practiced. For instance,
in Borneo, as we have seen, the Tungaras
use the sawing method, the Saribus Dyaks the
<i>besiapi</i>, or fire syringe, a most interesting fact,<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a>
other Dyaks the rotary drill,<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> while the Rev. Dr.
Taylor says that the Dyaks are acquainted with the use of the bow and
string and the upright stick and cord (pump drill). In connection with
all these methods probably flint and steel were used.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 42. <span class="sc">Malay Fire Sticks.</span>
<br /><span class="small">(Cat. No. 129775, U. S. N. M. Models in bamboo made by Mr. Hough after Prof. A. R. Wallace&rsquo;s description. The Malay Archipelago, p. 332.)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_570">570</div>
<p>So in Australia, while the rotary drill is the usual way, some tribes
have acquired the art of producing fire with knife or rubber, that is,
the sawing method presumably under foreign influence.<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></p>
<h2 id="c13">III.&mdash;FIRE-MAKING BY PLOWING.</h2>
<p>One of the most marked of fire-making methods in its distribution is
that pursued by the Pacific Islanders, confined almost entirely to the
Polynesian cultural area. It has spread to other
islands, however, being met with among the Negritos
of New Britain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They rub a sharpened piece of hard stick against the inside
of a piece of dried split bamboo. This has a natural dust that
soon ignites. They use soft wood when no bamboo can be procured,
but it takes longer to ignite. The flame is fed with
grass.<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a close connection between the Malay sawing
method and this, as there is a decided Malay preponderance
in the make-up of the population of the
Islands.</p>
<p>The fire-sticks shown (<a href="#fig43">fig. 43</a>) were procured by Mr.
Harold M. Sewall, at Samoa, and deposited in the
museum by him.</p>
<p>The wood is a light corky variety, probably of the
<i>Hibiscus tiliacus</i>, which is used for this purpose at
Tahiti, or perhaps it is of the paper mulberry. The
rubber may be of some hard wood, although fire may
be made by means of a rubber of the same kind of wood
as that of the hearth, though no doubt it requires a
longer time to make fire if this is done. In the Sandwich
Islands, Mr. Franklin Hale Austin, secretary of
the King, states that the rubber is of <i>koh</i> or <i>ohia</i>,
that is, hard wood and the hearth of <i>hon</i>, or soft wood,
and the friction is always in soft woods; this is true,
I believe, everywhere this method is practiced, in
spite of the fact that a soft rubber on hard wood will
answer as well.</p>
<p>Lieut. William I. Moore, U. S. Navy, gave the writer
a complete description of the manipulation of the Samoan
fire-getting apparatus.</p>

<br /><span class="small">(Cat. No. 130675, U. S. N. M. Samoa. Deposited by Harold M. Sewall.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The blunt pointed stick is taken between the clasped hands, somewhat
as one takes a pen, and projected forward from the body along the groove
at the greatest frictional angle consistent with the forward motion which
has been found to be from 40 to 45 degrees. Kneeling on the stick the
man forces the rubber forward, slowly at first, with a range of perhaps
<span class="pb" id="Page_571">571</span>
6 inches, till the wood begins to be ground off and made to go into a little
heap at the end of the groove; then he gradually accelerates the speed
and moves with a shorter range until, when he pushes the stick with
great velocity, the brown dust ignites. This is allowed to glow and if
it is required to be transferred to dry leaves or chips of wood it is done
by means of a tinder made of frayed or worn tapa cloth.</p>
<p>The groove (<a href="#fig43">fig. 43</a><i>a</i>) is the most characteristic feature of this apparatus,
there being apparently no definite form of implements for this purpose.
Fire is made on any billet of dry wood that is available. It is
not necessary to cut a slot, or even a groove, the hard wood rubber will
form one, so that there is no more need of apparatus than among the
Navajos, where two bits of yucca stalk collected near by form the fire
tools.</p>
<p>That making fire by this way is difficult to those inexperienced in it
is not strange. Mr. Darwin found it quite so, but at last succeeded.
The Samoan gets fire in forty seconds, and so great is the friction and
the wood so well adapted that Mr. Austin, before quoted, says it sometimes
actually bursts into flame.</p>
<p>The Australians in some parts use a method very much like the one
described. They rub a knife of wood along a groove made in another
stick previously filled with tinder.<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a></p>

<p class="lr">(&AElig;neid B. 1, 174-176.)</p>
</div>
<p>One of the oldest methods of fire-making that we know of is, that by
the percussion of flint and pyrites. It is believed to have been the
original discovery. If there is any difference in the difficulties of conception
and execution in either of the inventions, it lies in favor of the
sticks of wood.</p>
<p>The distribution of the flint and pyrites method, both in time and
place, is very interesting. Mr. Evans, in his epoch-making work,
&ldquo;Ancient Stone Implements,&rdquo; page 14, remarks that the name of pyrites
(&pi;&upsilon;&rho;, fire) is itself sufficient evidence of the purpose to which the mineral
was applied in ancient times. Whatever the fact is in Roman history,
the Eskimo calls pyrites firestone, some Indian tribes call flint firestone,
the German name for flint is <i>feuerstein</i>, and it is a reasonable
supposition that whatever people used flint or quartz, pyrites, or other
forms of iron ore for making fire, would call the stone firestone The
statement of Pliny that fire was first struck out of flint by Pyrod&eacute;, the
son of Cilix, Mr. Evans thinks, is a myth which points to the use of
silex and pyrites, rather than to steel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_572">572</div>
<p>Mr. Thomas Wilson calls my attention to a discovery of a pyrites
nodule by M. Gaillard, in a flint workshop on the island of Guiberon
in Brittany. The piece bore traces of use. Mr. Wilson thinks that
the curved flakes of flint like the one figured, found so numerously,
were used with pyrites as strike-a-lights. The comparative rarity of
pyrites is, perhaps, because it is easily decomposed and disintegrates
in unfavorable situations in a short time, so that the absence of pyrites
does not militate against the theory that it was used. A subcylindrical
nodule of pyrites 2&frac12; inches long and bruised at one end was found in
the cave of Les Eyzies, in the valley of V&eacute;z&egrave;re, Perigord, mentioned
in Reliquae Aquitanic&aelig;, page 248. This is supposed to have been a
strike-a-light.</p>
<p>Prof. W. B. Dawkins thinks that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In all probability the Cave-man obtained fire by the friction of one piece of hard
wood upon another, as is now the custom among many savage tribes. Sometimes,
however, as in the Trou de Chaleux, quoted by M. Dupont (Le Temps Prehistorique
en Belgique, second edition, page 153), he may have obtained a light by the friction of a
bit of flint against a piece of iron pyrites, as is usual with the Eskimos of the present
day.<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Dawkins also says that fire was obtained in the Bronze Age by
striking a flint flake against a piece of pyrites, sometimes found together
in the tumuli. He figures a strike-a-light from Seven Barrows, Lambourne,
Berks, England, an outline of which is reproduced here for comparison
with the one from Fort Simpson, British Columbia (<a href="#fig44">fig. 44</a><i>a</i>
and <i>b</i>). Pyrites has been found in a kitchen-midden at Ventnor, in
connection with Roman pottery.<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a> Chambers&rsquo;s Encyclop&aelig;dia, article,
Pyrites,<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> is authority for the statement that pyrites was used in kindling
powder in the pans of muskets before the gun flint was introduced.</p>
<p>It is thus seen that this art has a high antiquity, and that on its
ancient areas its use comes down nearly to the present day, the flint
and steel being its modern or allied form.</p>
<p>In North America this art is distributed among the more northerly
ranging Indian tribes, and the Eskimo of some parts. Its use was and
is yet quite prevalent among the Indians of the Athapascan (formerly
Tinn&eacute;) stock of the north. By specimens in the Museum, and notes of
explorers, it is found to range from north of Dixon&rsquo;s Sound to Labrador,
the following localities being represented, viz: Stikine River, Sitka,
Aleutian Islands, Kotzebue Sound, Point Barrow, the Mackenzie River
district, at Fort Simpson, and probably Hershel Island, Pelly Bay, Melville
Peninsula, Smith Sound, and Labrador. The Canadian and Algonquins
strike two pieces of pyrites (<i>pierres de mine</i>) together over an
eagle&rsquo;s thigh, dried with its down, and serving instead of tinder.<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a> From
<span class="pb" id="Page_573">573</span>
other sources we know that the extinct Beothucs, of Newfoundland,
did the same.<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a></p>
<p>As far as can be ascertained, the Eskimo and Indians both use the
method, so that it is not characteristic of either, as the four-part drill
is of the Eskimo, as contrasted with the simple rotation sticks of the
Indians. A description of a flint and pyrites outfit, as at present used,
will give a general idea of the status of the invention. In different
localities the manipulation differs somewhat, as will be noted farther on.</p>

<p>The strike-a-light (No. 128405) was collected by Capt. E. P. Herendeen
from natives who told him that it came from Cape Bathurst, hence
<span class="pb" id="Page_574">574</span>
he assigned the specimen to this
locality on the evidence. Mr.
John Murdoch has, with a great
deal of probability, questioned
this and thinks that it came
from Herschel Island with the
rest of Mr. Herendeen&rsquo;s collection
and did not come from as
far east as Cape Bathurst.
While there is no improbability
that this method is practiced at
Cape Bathurst, yet the specimen
has the appearance of the Mackenzie
River strike-a-lights,
hence it is deemed advisable to
locate it in the Mackenzie River
district at Herschel Island.</p>

</div>
<p>The essential parts of the apparatus
are a piece of pyrites, a
piece of flint and tinder. In the
more northern parts of the
Eskimo area, tinder is made
from the down from the stems and catkins of various species of dwarf
arctic willows. At present the
natives often soak the tinder in
a strong solution of gunpowder
and water to make it quick; an
older way was to mix powdered
charcoal with it. This plan is
like the charring of the linen rags
used in the old-fashioned tinder
boxes of forty years ago. The
Eskimo then puts the tinder into
a little round, flat pouch, with a
flap in the middle (<a href="#fig45">fig. 45</a>, 1).</p>

</div>
<p>The pyrites (<a href="#fig46">fig. 46</a>, 3) looks like
a short pestle, too much of which
appearance the repeated scraping
has no doubt given rise. The upper
end is concave, while the lower
end has the original smooth surface
of the concretion. Pyrite is
found at Point Barrow in spherical
masses of various sizes up to
several pounds in weight. These
spheres are nearly always cracked
in two and scraped on the plane
<span class="pb" id="Page_575">575</span>
surface for very obvious reasons. This gives the shape seen in Fort
Simpson and Long Barrows specimen. Mr. Murdoch says that the Eskimo
think that pyrites comes down from above in meteors. They call
it &ldquo;firestone.&rdquo; A native related that in old times they did not use
flint, but two pieces of pyrites, and got &ldquo;big fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flint (<a href="#fig46">fig. 46</a>, 4) is an oblong piece of chert, square at the base
and rounded at the forward end. It is more elaborately made than the
flakes so numerous in Europe, one of which was found with the piece
of pyrites in the English Barrows. The Mackenzie River scraper is
more like the curved ancient one (<a href="#fig44">fig. 44</a><i>b</i>). In most cases the flints
used are not mounted in a handle; this specimen, however, is fixed in a
handle made of two pieces of wood held together by a thong of sealskin
(<a href="#fig46">fig. 46</a>, 4<i>a</i>).</p>
<p>The bag (<a href="#fig45">fig. 45</a>, 2) is made of reindeer skin. The little bag that
hangs from the larger has a double use; it is a receptacle for reserve
tinder, but its chief use is for a toggle; being passed under the belt it
prevents the loss of the outfit, which is said to be carried by the
women.</p>
<p>An oblong pad, stuffed with deer hair, is sewed to the mouth of the
fire-bag to protect the hand from sparks and blows of the flint.</p>
<p>To get a spark, the Eskimo places (<a href="#fig47">fig. 47</a>) the piece of pyrites on the
pad held in the left hand over the curved
forefinger, the large end down and the
thumb set in the cup shaped cavity in
the top. The flap of the tinder pocket
is turned back and held on the forefinger
under the protecting pad. The flint is
held in the right hand and by a scraping
motion little pieces of pyrites at a
dull red heat fall down into the tinder.
The pellet that glows is transferred to
the pipe or fire, and the flap of the tinder
pocket is turned down, serving to keep
the tinder dry and to extinguish it if
necessary.<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a></p>

</div>
<p>There comes in here appropriately a
note of B. R. Ross on the burial customs
of the Kutchin Indians of the eastern
Athapascan stock. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They bury with the dead a flint fastened to a
stick, a stone to strike it on (pyrites) to make fire, and a piece of the fungus that
grows on the birch tree for tinder and some touch-wood also.<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no mention of this process of fire-making by the older writers
<span class="pb" id="Page_576">576</span>
on Greenland, Cranz and Egede, though they carefully note and describe
the plan by wood-boring. Later explorers going higher north in
western Greenland have found it. Dr. Emil Bessels, writing about the
Itah Eskimo of Smith Sound, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The catkins of the arctic willow are used as tinder to catch the sparks which have
been produced through the grinding of two pieces of stone.<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. E. K. Kane gives a more complete account from nearly the same
locality, the Arctic Highlands of northwest Greenland. He says that
the Eskimo of Anoatok struck fire from two stones, one a plain piece
of angular milky quartz, held in the right hand, the other apparently
an oxide of iron [pyrites or iron ore?] They were struck together after
the true tinder-box fashion, throwing a scanty supply of sparks on a
tinder composed of the silky down of the willow catkins (<i>Salix lanata</i>)
which he held on a lump of dried moss.<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a></p>
<p>Very much farther west on Melville Peninsula Parry gives a complete
and interesting description of the primitive way. This account
gives us a link between the western and eastern Eskimo. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the purpose of obtaining fire, the Eskimo use two lumps of common pyrites,
from which sparks are struck into a little leathern case (see <a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>, pl. <span class="small">LXXIV</span>) containing
moss well dried and rubbed between the hands. If this tinder does not readily
catch, a small quantity of the white floss of the seed of the ground willow is laid
above the moss. As soon as a spark has caught it is gently blown till the fire has
spread an inch around, when the pointed end of a piece of wick being applied, it
soon bursts into a flame, the whole process having occupied perhaps two or three
minutes.<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Museum was in possession of a specimen catalogued, &ldquo;Moss-bag
and lumps of pyrites used by Innuit for getting fire,&rdquo; collected by
Capt. C. F. Hall at Pelly Bay, in latitude 69&deg;, longitude 90&deg;, several
degrees west of Melville Peninsula.</p>
<p>The only other record of the process under consideration among the
Eskimo is found in the Aleutian Islands. There is absolutely no evidence
had by the writer that the Eskimo south of Kotzebue Sound
(Western Eskimo) use the pyrites and flint for making fire. The latest
information about the Aleutian Islanders is given in a manuscript
of the careful explorer, Mr. Lucien M. Turner. His observation will
serve to explain the description of striking a light by earlier travelers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They use the four part drill but they also use pyrites. A stone containing quartz
and pyrites is struck against another similar one, or a beach pebble, into a mass of
sea bird down sprinkled with powdered sulphur. This ignites and is quickly caught
on finely shredded blades of grass or beaten stalks of wild parsnips. This method
prevails to this day on the islands west of Unalashka.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The people told Mr. Turner that this was the ancient way. There is
a doubt in the writer&rsquo;s mind that Sauer&rsquo;s (Billing&rsquo;s Expedition, page
59), and Campbell&rsquo;s (Voyage, page 59) observations, brought together
by Bancroft,<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a>
were accurate with regard to the stones used. All the
<span class="pb" id="Page_577">577</span>
other details are correct, but they say they took two pieces of quartz,
rubbed them with sulphur, and struck them together. It is well known
that pieces of quartz even when rubbed with sulphur will not strike
a spark of sufficient heat to cause ignition. The pieces used must
have been pyritiferous quartz as noticed by Mr. L. M. Turner.</p>
<p>To resume, the following facts arise out of the foregoing considerations
of the flint and pyrites method:</p>
<p>(1) It is very ancient, inferring from the few reliable finds of pyrites
and flint in juxtaposition.</p>
<p>(2) Its distribution is among high northern tribes, both Eskimo and
Indian.</p>
<p>(3) As far as known, its range is limited to this area, only one other
instance coming to our notice, that of the Fuegians.</p>
<h3 id="c16">2. FLINT AND STEEL.</h3>
<p>The flint and pyrites method is the ancestor of the flint and steel.
The latter method came in with the Iron Age. It is found in the early
settlements of that period. A steel for striking fire was found in the
pile dwellings of the Ueberlinger See.<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> The Arch&aelig;ological Department
of the Museum has a specimen of a strike-a-light of the early age of
iron in Scandinavia. It is a flat, oval quartz stone with a groove
around the edge; it is thought to be for holding a strap by which it
could be held up and struck along the flat surface with the steel. It is
scored on these surfaces. The specimen in the Smithsonian is from
the national museum at Stockholm. In Egypt it is believed to have been
used for a long period, though there is no data at hand to support the
conclusion.<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> In China it has been in use for many centuries. Chinese
history, however, goes back to the use of sticks of wood. The <i>briquet</i>
must have been carried nearly everywhere by early commerce from the
ancient countries around the Mediterranean, as it was into new lands
by later commerce.</p>
<p>Many persons remember the tinder-box that was taken from its
warm nook beside the fire-place whenever a light was wanted; the
matches tipped with sulphur used to start a blaze from the glowing tinder
are also familiar to the older generation. The tinder-boxes in use
in this country were just like those in England from time immemorial
down to fifty years ago (<a href="#fig48">fig. 48</a>). Mr. Edward Lovett, of Croydon,
England, who has studied this matter thoroughly, calls attention to the
resemblance of the old English tinder-flints to the neolithic scrapers.
These scrapers, picked up at Brandon, can scarcely be discriminated
from those made at the present time at that place, and there is a suspicion
that the present tinder-flint has come down directly from neolithic
times. The old English steel, or &ldquo;Flourish,&rdquo; (<a href="#fig48">fig. 48</a>) is the characteristic
shape, and has been carried by English commerce into many
places. A picture of a strike-a-light used by the Lenguas of Brazil,
seen lately, shows the unmistakable old &ldquo;flourish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_578">578</div>

<br /><span class="small">(Cat. No 75516, U. S. N. M. England. Collected by Louis and Maurice Farmer.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The tinder-boxes had also a damper to extinguish the tinder of burnt
linen and to keep it dry. The lids were furnished often with a candle
socket. This feature, says Mr. Lovett, has led to their preservation as
candle-sticks long after they were superseded by matches.</p>

<br /><span class="small">(Cat No. 130431, U. S. N. M. Broadalbin, N. Y. Presented by F. S. Hawley.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Many devices were invented in order to improve on the crude way of
holding the flint and steel in the hands to strike the spark into the
tinder-box. One of these was the wheel tinder-box (<a href="#fig49">fig. 49</a>). The compartment
near the wheel held the tinder. The flint was placed in a
socket on the sliding lid, and the wheel was turned by unwinding a
string from off its axle with a sharp pull as in spinning a top. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_579">579</span>
flint was pressed against the rapidly revolving wheel and a shower of
sparks fell into the tinder. The tinder pistol, whose name suggests its
use, was another device.<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a></p>
<p>Other devices were intended to be carried in the pocket, and were
probably brought out by the introduction of tobacco and the need of
smokers for a convenient light.</p>

</div>
<p>The pocket strike-a-light is still used. The one shown (<a href="#fig50">fig. 50</a>) was
bought in 1888 by Mr. E. Lovett, at Boulogne-sur-mer. They are still
used by the peasants and work-people of France. An old specimen
in the Museum of this character is from Lima. The roll of tinder, or
&ldquo;match,&rdquo; is made of the soft inner bark of a tree.</p>
<p>Among many of our North American tribes the flint and steel superseded
the wooden drills as effectually as did the iron points the stone
arrow-heads.</p>
<p>Some of these tribes were ripe for the introduction of many modern
contrivances. Civilized methods of fire-lighting appealed to them at
once. Among the Chukchis, Nordenski&ouml;ld says, matches had the honor
of being the first of the inventions of the civilized races that have been
recognized as superior to their own.<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a> It was so among our Indian
tribes; the Mandan chief &ldquo;Four Bears&rdquo; lighted his pipe by means of a
flint and steel taken from his pouch when George Catlin visited him
in 1832.<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a></p>
<p>The Otoes (Siouan stock) made use of the flint and steel shown in
<a href="#fig51">fig. 51</a>. The flint is a chipped piece of gray chert, probably an ancient
implement picked up from the surface.</p>
<p>The steel is a very neatly made oval, resembling those of the Albanian
strike-a-lights,<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a> or the Koordish pattern, (<a href="#fig54">fig. 54</a>). Here arises one of
the perplexities of modern intercourse, perhaps both of these steels
were derived from the same commercial center.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_580">580</div>
<p>The flint, steel, and tinder were always carried in a pouch, usually
suspended from a belt as in specimen No. 8481 from the Assiniboins
(Siouan stock) of Dakota. This is a buckskin waist-belt, beaded and
fringed, ornamented with bells of tin. It supports a flapped pouch for
the flint, etc. The tinder used was fungus.</p>

</div>
<p>The pouch of the Cheyennes (Algonquian stock) is compact, and neatly
made of leather (<a href="#fig52">fig. 52</a>). The equipment is complete and of a superior
order. The bone cup is used to hold the tinder while striking a
spark into it. It is the tinder horn of early days, a cow&rsquo;s horn which was
used to hold tinder before sheet-iron boxes came into use. The Lenguas
of Brazil use a horn for the same purpose.<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a> In the Aino set, (<a href="#fig57">fig. 57</a>),
and the Eskimo strike-a-light, (<a href="#fig45">fig. 45</a>), can be seen this feature. The
tinder with this set is rotten wood. Nearly all Indians know the value
of fungus tinder.</p>
<p>The Comanche Indian strike-a-light is a similar pouch to the one described,
but much poorer in equipment (<a href="#fig53">fig. 53</a>.) A broken rasp, a piece
of chert, and a piece of spunk, is enough for the purpose, and a bag made
from a saddle skirt to hold them, completes the outfit.</p>
<p>The flint and steel is still used nearly all over Mexico, Dr. Palmer
informs me. There is at present a manufacture of gun and strike-a-light
flints at Brandon, England, whence they are shipped to Spain,
<span class="pb" id="Page_581">581</span>
Mexico, Italy, and other civilized countries. Doubtless this flint from
Guadalajara (<a href="#fig54">fig. 54</a>) came from Brandon. It is real calcareous flint, such
as does not exist in this country. The flint is the &ldquo;swallow-tail&rdquo; pattern.
The tinder is of prepared fungus sold in little packets.</p>

besides flint, steel, and tinder, a pipe pick and a pair of pincers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_582">582</span>
to transfer the lighted tinder to the pipe (<a href="#fig55">fig. 55</a>). The tinder is prepared
from a fungus, probably <i>polyporus</i> species. The steel, shaped
like an old-fashioned bell pull, is a very good form for holding in the
hand.</p>

</div>
<p>The Chinese strike-a-light is the customary appendage to the pipe
pouch. It is a very ingenious way of combining the steel with a pouch
in which to keep the flint and tinder (<a href="#fig56">fig. 56</a>). In Thibet they are made
very large and are finely decorated. One owned by Mr. W. W. Rockhill
has a curving steel between 5 and 6 inches long, finely carved.
The pouch was trimmed with encrusted silver set with jewels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_583">583</div>
<p>The Ainos of Japan use flint and steel for striking-a-light, this method
having supplanted the generation of fire by sticks (<a href="#Page_551">p. 551</a>.) This outfit
shown (<a href="#fig57">fig. 57</a>, pl. <span class="small">LXXXI</span>) is complete. The shoe-shaped steel is attached
by a piece of sinew to the cork of a small wooden bottle containing
the soft charcoal used as tinder. The flint is a small piece
of ferruginous silex. With this set is a piece of stick which retains
fire for a long time. It is the root
of the <i>Ulmus campestris</i>, or <i>l&aelig;vis</i>,
formerly used for the fire-drill (see
<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>), but has come into a secondary
place since the introduction
of the flint and steel.</p>

<p>To strike a light the Aino takes out the cork with the steel attached
and stirs up the tinder with the sharp point. He then holds up the
flint in his hand over the box and strikes a spark down into it. He
then transfers the coal to his pipe, or material for fire, or fire-stick, with
the point of the steel. These articles are kept in a rush pouch of
twined weaving. A much ruder pouch of fishskin is in the Museum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_585">585</div>
<p>The Japanese tinder-box has two compartments, one with a damper
for the tinder, and the other larger one for the flint and steel. This box
is a familiar object in Japanese kitchens yet. The mounting of the steel
in wood is an improvement on holding it between the fingers (fig. <a href="#fig58">58</a> and <a href="#fig59">59</a>).
No one it seems ever thought of so mounting the steel in Western
countries. The matches are broad shavings tipped at both ends with
sulphur, and are the Japanese rendering of the &ldquo;spunks&rdquo; used with our
tinder-box.</p>

<p>Smokers in Japan carry a very small strike-a-light (<a href="#fig60">fig. 60</a>). The
cloth pouch with a long flap that can be rolled around several times and
tied, contains the three essentials, flint, steel, and tinder, the latter of
burnt cotton.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
